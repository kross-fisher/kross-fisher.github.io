        <h1>The Gentle Hand</h1>

        <p>
            Once upon a time, as I was passing through a district of country
            where not many people lived, night came before I knew it. Being
            on foot, I could not hope to get to the village toward which I was
            going until a late hour. I therefore preferred seeking shelter for
            a night in the first house that I came to.
        </p>
        <p>
            It had grown dark, when I found myself near a house. From the small
            uncurtained windows of the house the light shone. I imagined how
            cheerfuland comfortable it would be in that house. The house stood 
            within a yard, and a short distance from the road along which I was
            moving with tired feet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I turned aside and went to the yard. The gate was not locked. I
            passed through it and aproached the house. The door closed slowly
            by itself. When I had nearly reached the porch in front of the
            house, I saw a slim girl, who had noticed my entrance, stood
            waiting for my arrival.
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as the gate shut, I heard a deep, quick bark, and,
            suddenly, the form of a big dog appeared in the doorway. At the
            instant when he was about to jump, a light hand was laid upon his
            hairy neck, and a low word spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Go in, Tiger." said the girl, not in a voice of order, yet from
            her tones I could tell that she knew she would be obeyed. As she
            spoke, she gently touched the animal with her hand, and he turned
            away and disappeared within the house.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Who's that?" A rough voice asked the question; and now a
            heavy-looking man took the dog's place in the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            "How far is it to G--?" I asked, not daring to say, in the
            beginning, that I sought a resting-place for the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            "To G--!" said the man, but not so cruelly as at first. "It's
            good six miles from here."
        </p>
        <p>
            "A long distance; and I'm a stranger, and on foot," said I. "If 
            you can make room for me until morning, I will be very thankful."
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw the girl's hand move quickly up his arm, until it rested on
            shoulder, and now she leaned to him still closer.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Come in. We'll try what can be done for you." There was a change
            in the man's voice that made me wonder. I entered a large room,
            in which there was a warm fire. Before the fire sat two children,
            who turned to look at me, with not very welcome greeting. A 
            middle-aged woman was standing at a table, and two children were 
            amusing themselves with a cat on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
            "A stranger, mother," said the man who had given me so rude a 
            greeting at the door; "And he wants us to let him stay all night."
        </p>
        <p>
            The woman looked at me doubtfully for a few moments, and then
            replied coldly, "We don't keep a hotel."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm aware of that, madam," said I, "But it is night, and it's 
            a long way yet to G--."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Too far for a tired man to go on foot," said the master of the 
            house, kindly, "So it's no use talking about it, mother; we must
            give him a bed."
        </p>
        <p>
            I noticed the girl came to her mother's side. What she said to
            her I did not hear, for she spoke in a low voice; but I noticed,
            as she spoke, one small, fair hand rested on the woman's hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Was there magic in that touch? The woman's cold face changed into
            one of kindly welcome, and she said: "Yes, it's a long way to G--.
            I guess we can find a place for him."
        </p>
        <p>
            Many times more during that evening, I observed the magic power of
            that hand and voice -- the one gentle yet powerful as the other.
            On the next morning, breakfast being over, I was preparing to leave
            when my host told me that if I would wait for half an hour he would
            give me a ride in his wagon to G--, as he had to go there on 
            business. I was very pleased to accept the invitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            At last the farmer's wagon was driven into the road before the 
            house, and I was invited to get in. I noticed the horse as a 
            rough-looking Canadian pony. He looked rather stubborn. As the 
            farmer took his seat by my side, the family came to the door to 
            see us off.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Dick!" said the farmer in a hard voice, giving the rein a quick 
            pull as he spoke. But Dick did not move a step. "Dick! Get up."
            And the farmer's whip cracked sharply by the pony's ear.
        </p>
        <p>
            This did not get the pony moving, however. Dick stood firmly,
            without obeying. Next he impatiently brought the whip down upon
            the pony; but the pony only moved up a little. The man beat the
            pony several times. He might as well have beaten the wagon, for 
            all his efforts had been made.
        </p>
        <p>
            A child now came out into the road, and, catching Dick by rein,
            pulled him hard forward, but Dick still would not obey. He
            planted his fore feet more firmly and at a sharper angle with 
            the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            The impatient boy now struck the pony on the side of the head 
            with his hand, and pulled cruelly at its rein. It was no use,
            however; Dick just would not move.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't do so, John!" I turned my head as the girl's sweet voice
            reached my ear. She was passing through the gate into the road,
            and, in the next moment, had taken hold of the child and drawn
            him away from the animal. She did not use strength in this; she 
            took hold of his arm, and he obeyed her wish willingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            And now that soft hand was laid gently on the pony's neck, and 
            a single low word spoken. How immediately were the tense muscle 
            relaxed -- how quickly the stubborn air disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Poor Dick!" said the girl, as she stroked his neck lightly; or
            softly patted it with a childlike hand. "Now, go along, you
            annoying fellow!" she added, in a half-blaming, yet affectionate
            voice, as she drew up the rein.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pony turned toward her, and rubbed his head against her arm
            for an instant or two; then, sticking up his ears, he started off
            cheerfully, and went on his way as freely as if nothing unpleasant
            had happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What a wonderful power that hand has!" said I, speaking to my 
            companion, as we rode away.
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked at me for a moment, as if he was surprised by my remark.
            Then a light came into his face, and he said briefly, "She's good!
            Everybody and everything loves her."
        </p>
        <p>
            Was that, indeed, the secret of her power?
        </p>
        <p>
            Was the quality of her soul felt in her hand, even by beasts? 
            The farmer's explanation was certainly the true one. Yet have I 
            ever since wondered, and still do wonder, at the strength which 
            lay in that girl's magic touch. I have seen something of the same
            power, showing itself in the loving and the good, but never so
            strong as shown in her, whom, for want of a better name, I must 
            still call "Gentle Hand".
