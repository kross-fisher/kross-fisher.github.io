    <p>
        When I was 14 and very confused about my place in the world, I
        decided it was time to make a Big Decision. I came home from school
        one day to announce that I was going to take part in
        professional-agriculture courses. I was not going to college; I was
        going to raise horses for a living.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dad looked shocked, then puzzled, "That's a rather careless decision,"
        he said. "I hope you've given it careful consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
        I replied that I had, and that I knew exactly what I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
        "You're talking about a large decision," he said. "If you spend four 
        years in professional courses, you won't have a choice about college.
        what if you change your mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
        Mother listened to our discussion with concern. Neither of my parents
        had been to college, buth both hoped I would go. To make it possible,
        Dad was working at a regular job until 3 p. m., then another four or
        five hours a day at the little farm we owned on the edge of town.
    </p>
    <p>
        "How much have you saved toward this project?" asked Dad.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Nearly $200." I said proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Tell you what," he said. "I know a ranch up in the northern part of
        the state where they raise horses. Let's drive up there next week.
        You buy a mare. You care for her, have her give birth, sell the
        young horse. Then, after a year or two, if you feel the way you do
        now, fine. Meanwhile, stay with your regular courses."
    </p>
    <p>
        The horse-buying trip sounded good, and the offer, as ussual with 
        Dad, was fair. I agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the day came, we left early, putting the dry, flat plains behind
        us the sun rose. By mid-morning, we were in the high mountains of
        northern New Mexico. We arrived at Miguel's ranch toward evening. Dad
        had known Miguel for years, and we were welcomed with great warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ranch was exactly what I ahd in mind for myself. There was a long
        low house. Behind the house, there was a thick pine wood at the foot
        of the mountains, already with snow on the tops.
    </p>
    <p>
        "It's hard to understand Miguel sometimes," I said to Dad after
        dinner. "His English is kind of funny."
    </p>
    <p>
        "You have to pay close attention," Dad said. "Or learn Spanish."
    </p>
    <p>
        About nine the next morning, other horse buyers began to arrive.
        One especially caught my attention. He was small and well dressed,
        and seemed to regard himself with some importance.
    </p>
    <p>
        While a ranchman rode off to bring in the animals to be sold, Dad
        took me aside. "Now, think carefully," he warned. "Don't make any
        sudden decisions."
    </p>
    <p>
        I nodded, only half listening, as the ranch man moved 12 or 14 horses
        toward the corral. They were beautiful animals, especially a shining 
        chestnut mare. She held her head well, but there was something strange
        about her walk. I was about to point her out to Dad when I heard the
        little man, the important one, yell, "How much you want for chestnut
        mare?"
    </p>
    <p>
        Miguel hesitated, appearing confused. "Maybe $75," he said with a
        shrug. "But she... she don't look always too well."
    </p>
    <p>
        "She looks all right to me." the small man said.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I'll give you a hundred." I interrupted, unable to control myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The little man's head suddenly turned around. His eyes looked hot.
        "Make it $125!" he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Miguel's face clouded with frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
        "One-twenty five!" the little man insisted. "Is that a deal?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Okay, okay," Miguel said. "But I'm telling you, that horse, she's 
        not too well."
    </p>
    <p>
        The little mare was saddled up. Her new owner swung into the saddle
        and rode her toward the gate. Obviously pleased, he was about to say
        something when the mare walked straight into the gatepost, staggered
        and nearly lost her rider.
    </p>
    <p>
        The little man jumped down and began inspecting the mare's eyes.
        Miguel watched coolly. "Why," came the man's sharp complaint, "This
        mare is blind!"
    </p>
    <p>
        Miguel, almost purple with frustration, shouted back across the corral:
        "I told you! I told you! How many times have I got to tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
        There was a moment of tense silence before first one and then another
        of the buyers began to laugh quietly. Finally, the little man himself
        joined in, shaking his head at his mistake. "You still want her for a
        hundred?" he called over to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        "No." I said, with a red face.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Offer him $25." my father said.
    </p>
    <p>
        "But, Dad, she's blind."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Moon-blind," Dad said. "Miguel told me about her last night. She's
        blind for short periods. she may go totally blind, or she may not.
        Anyway, she looks as if she might produce some good baby horses."
    </p>
    <p>
        "How about $25?" I yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
        "You got her." the little man said.
    </p>
    <p>
        I named her "Sadie," and we loaded her into the truck. We said
        good-bye to the Miguel's family and started home. "You know, Dad,"
        I said after a time, "Miguel's place is exactly the kind of place 
        I'd like to have someday."
    </p>
    <p>
        "That's the kind of place you get only through lots of hard work,"
        Dad said. "And speaking of hard work, since you'll have to be going 
        to the farm every day to feed and water Sadie, why don't you just
        take the farm over? I'll rent it to you. I'll pay for everything.
        You do all the work. You keep 20 percent of the income. It'll be 
        like your own professional-agriculture course."
    </p>
    <p>
        "I think I'd like that. Yes... I'll do it!" I said, excited at the 
        thought of doing something more actual than school.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Well, now, maybe you'd better consider it some time." Dad suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
        "No, that's not necessary," I said. "I want to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
        Within a month, I was taking the truck to school so I could go directly
        to the farm in the afternoon. Through the winter, I worked on the barn
        and repaired fences. When the conservation district turned irrigation
        water on for spring planting, I had to get up at 4 a. m. to move the
        water pipes from one area of the field to another, and go back at
        4 p. m. to repeat the job. Throughout the summer, I drove the tractor
        on endless rounds, planting, tending, irrigating, and repairing 
        equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In September, Sadie produced Sam, a beautiful chestnut baby with a red
        face and two stocking feet. Sadie's moon blindness hadn't changed. She
        would go blind for a few days, then be all right for several weeks.
        She was a good mother, and I found that I couldn't stand the thought
        of selling her or the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was also finding out exactly how hard farming is. And so I was more 
        than ready when Dad's invitation came in October. "About time to go
        and buy horses again, isn't it, boy?" he asked one evening at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I don't think I want to buy more horses," I said. "But could we go 
        anyway, and maybe just look around for a few days?"
    </p>
    <p>
        As so often happened, Dad was well ahead of me. We didn't go to 
        Miguel's place again. Instead, we went to a remote valley where,
        hundreds of years before, Indians had lived in tiny apartments carved
        into the steep rock face of the valley walls. As we wandered around 
        that frightening ruin, I tried to imagine how it must have looked when
        it was occupied. Then I discovered a mysterious, round room beneath
        the ground with a ladder leading down to it. "What do you suppose this
        was for?" I asked Dad.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Son," he said, "I have no idea. But I bet you could find out in books."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Where would I find those books?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Well," he said, "I imagine the library at the university has them."
    </p>
    <p>
        We walked in silence for a moment. "You know, Dad," I said, finally.
        "I do love the farm, and taking care of Sadie, and all that. But,
        well, it seems there are a lot of other interesting things to do, too."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sounds to me as if you've been 'considering'." Dad said.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, of course, I did go to college. Dad drove over one fall
        day of my first year, and picked me up at the dormitory. We had no
        destination. We just drove slowly through the mountains, feeling good 
        about being together. Over dinner, I told him about my course and my
        plans.
    </p>
    <p>
        When he dropped me back at the dormitory that night, he offered his
        hand. "Well, son," he said, "I guess our horse-buying days are about 
        over. But we bought some pretty good ones, wouldn't you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
        I nodded, unable for a moment to speak. I looked beyond him to where 
        the library stood alone, brightly lighted. "Dad," I said, "I found
        out what the Indians used that little room for."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Oh?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "It was a place where men taught boys about life... kind of like
        horse-buying time."
    </p>
    <p>
        He tried to smile, but the muscles of his face hesitated. "Write your
        mother," he said sharply. "She misses you."
    </p>
    <p>
        When he was gone, I sat outside for a long time. When the lights went 
        out at the library, the stars seemed to shine bright still, and I 
        stayed to watch them.
