            Two years ago I was working as a dishwasher at a girls' summer
            camp. It was for inner-city kids, most of them young black girls,
            thin and tough. I was the only boy at the camp. My mother was the
            cook and we shared s small cabin on the edge of the camp. Rules
            were that I was to stay away from the girls and they were to stay
            away from me. Of course, it never happened that way. The girls
            were always up to one trick or another. They liked to put my
            underwear up the flagpole and things like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although my job was to wash dishes, I ended up helping with other
            work too. For example, I had to carry mattresses that had been wet
            during the night down to the tennis court, where they could dry
            out. It was a rather boring summer until Amy arrived. Amy isn't her
            real name. I'm keeping that a secret because she deserves a life of
            her own. Amy was about seven years old. Her hair was done in tiny
            braids, each with a colorful bead on the end. But the thing that
            was most remarkable about her was that she didn't speak to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom explained to me that Amy had been locked in the closet for
            months when she was five years old. Her mother had put her there
            because she had to wrok during the day and didn't want Amy to hurt
            herself by falling down the stairs or being hit by a car. When a
            neighbor discovered Amy's situation, she reported it. Amy was
            taken away from her mother and put into a foster home. Since then,
            Amy hadn't spoken at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            After hearing the story, I couldn't sleep. I thought about how
            awful it was to be poor and how much Amy had suffered.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started to keep an eye on her during the day. It was true:
            She wouldn't speak to anyone. She wetted the bed every night
            so I had to go to her cabin in the morning and carry her
            mattress down to the court. I would have carried that mattress
            all the way to California for her.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes she followed me down to the tennis court. "Amy," I
            would ask her, "what's your secret?"
        </p>
        <p>
            She would just smile back. Areally attractive little smile that
            just about broke my heart. Then I started to notice something
            else about Amy. After lunch most of the kids got letters from
            mothers or fathers. No letters came for Amy. All the same, she
            kept looking at the person who was calling out the names and
            handing out the mail as though She expected her name to be
            called any minute.
        </p>
        <p>
            At night I used to sit on a bench at the beach, just to think
            and look out over the lake. As I approached the benches one
            night I saw Any sitting there, her feet swinging back and
            forth.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hey, Amy," I said, sitting next to her. "you should be in bed."
        </p>
        <p>
            She didn't answer me. she looked up and smiled.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Amy, what's your secret?" I asked as I looked out over the
            water.
        </p>
        <p>
            She didn't answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'll tell you what my secret is. You see that light there, on
            the other side of the water?"
        </p>
        <p>
            She didn't say anything, but out of the corner of my eye I
            could see she was looking across the lake.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I like looking at that light. For me it's like my dream. Do you
            understand what I mean?"
        </p>
        <p>
            She still didn't answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And I don't know what my dream is yet. Right now it's something
            like a light that shines inside of me and makes me feel that one
            day I'm going to do something important with my life."
        </p>
        <p>
            She leaned her head against my arm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Or maybe this is my dream right here at camp -- to be washing
            dishes and carrying mattresses down to the tennis court, and
            sitting here with a little girl who has braids and beads all
            over her head."
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't know if she was listening to me. It was hard to tell
            because she didn't speak. After a while I picked her up and 
            carried her back to her cabin and put her to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I went back to my cabin. I just couldn't get Amy out of
            my mind. I started thinking about how she'd be waiting full
            of hope for mail the next day after lunch. So I draw a picture
            of the lake with a big light shining on the other side of it.
            I folded it up, put it in an envelope and wrote her name on
            it. Then I went over to the dining hall and put the letter in 
            the mail pile.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day when the mail was handed out I watched Amy sitting
            there all hopeful. When her name was called she went up to get 
            that letter. Then she sat down, opened it and looked at the
            picture. She didn't stop looking even when everyone else was
            leaving the dining hall. So I went over and asked, "Hey, Amy,
            what's your secret?"
        </p>
        <p>
            She didn't answer. She looked at the picture, then looked at me,
            then put the picture over her heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            It made me sad because I knew that's all I could do for Amy. I
            was just a kid. If I had money I'd try to send her to school or
            maybe go to court and get her mom back and give them both the
            money they needed for a nice life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Really, though, there was nothing I could do but give her a
            picture of a light across a lake to remind her of a dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the last day of camp she gave me a big hug goodbye, which
            for me was worth a million words. It toldme I had touched her
            and she would't forget our secret. Maybe she had a dream of her
            own. I hope so. Though it might not seem like that much, getting
            to know Amy that summer was the most moving experience I've ever
            had. She taught me what dreams are made of.
