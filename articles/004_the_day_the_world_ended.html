        <h1>The Day the World Ended</h1>
        <p class="credits">by Theodora Templeton</p>
        <p>
            I still remember the day the world was going to end. I have 
            forgotten the exact date, for it was so long ago. But I remember 
            everything else, because of Jed. I loved him and he loved me, even 
            though I was only twelve year old.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jed's family was strange, so completely different from my own. 
            They never thought twice about money, never tried to save some 
            for a day of need. They said God would take care of them and 
            their children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suck talk made my grandfather very angry, because it was always 
            he, not God, who had to take care of them when they were in 
            trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Jewel and his family belonged to a religious group which we 
            called the Believers. They were sure that one day soon the world
            was going to end: the Bible said so. Grandfather tried to argue 
            with them about this Belief, but they refused to listen to what 
            he said.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were forty families that belonged to their church.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grandfather at first gave no thought to this talk about Judgment 
            Day.
        </p>
        <p>
            He did not know that the Believers had already made careful plans 
            for their Day of Judgment. They had decided to meet at the foot of
            a hill not far from our farm. They would slowly climb the hill
            singing psalms. And when they reached the top of the hill they
            would just wait there for the world to die before sundown and for 
            haven to open and take them upward in a body.
        </p>
        <p>
            At school, the children talked of nothing but the coming of the 
            end of the world, on any day now. Like their fathers and mothers, 
            they laughed, or did not believe it, or did not know what to 
            believe...
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, one night, Mr. Jewel came to our home house and informed 
            grandfather that the Believers were giving away everything they 
            owned. And he looked carefully at grandfather and said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is our decision to enter into the kindom of heaven free of 
            all worldly things. All of us have given away or will give away 
            our earthly goods, down to the last spoon. We can now meet God 
            with nothing to show that greed for material things which eats
            away the spirit of man. I have already given away my three cows,
            my pigs and my chickens. Martha has given away her things. I know 
            better than to ask you to do the same, so that you can meet your
            Maker in pure and joyous victory over worldliness. I can not get
            you to do this, and so I ask you to take my farm..."
        </p>
        <p>
            Grandfather exploded. "You goose, I own most of it already, and I
            won't have it. What piece of foolishness are you up to now?"
        </p>
        <p>
            I had never seen my grandfather so angry. He shouted and hit the
            table. But grandfather's anger meant nothing to Mr. Jewel. He
            said: "I hope that God will forgive you." And he left.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, grandfather could not open his mouth. Then, he said: 
            "Now, they have done it. Those crazy people have done it. They've 
            given away everything they had -- land, houses, money and animals.
            What can I do now?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Aunt Mary said, "There is nothing you can do now. But you will
            have to help him when he comes down that hill."
        </p>
        <p>
            We could do nothing but wait, wait nervously for the day they 
            decided to choose as Judgment Day. And, of course, it came, as
            all days must. It was a bright day. Hundreds of people started
            coming to the bottom of the hill to watch the event. They became 
            a crowd. Most came to laugh or two watch a strange ceremony.
            Still, behind their laughter, many were afraid -- afraid that 
            perhaps -- who knows -- the world might end that very day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grandfather, Aunt Mary and I stood together. We were sad, and 
            said nothing. Then, suddenly, there they came -- the Believers
            -- men, women and children walking slowly and silently, with 
            their heads up, like soldiers. Only one of them turned his head. 
            It was Jed, who turned to look at me. Just then they began to 
            sing. I made a move forward, but grandfather caught and held me.
            He said Jed would be back when the sun went down. I said, "He will 
            feel terrible when he does."
        </p>
        <p>
            "And a good thing," sneered Deacon Paine, a dried-up old man who 
            stood near us. Grandfather turned on him and said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Who asked for your opinion? I think we owe these brave and good 
            people a great deal. They have given us something. Who else would
            have had the courage to test the Lord?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The man made a noise and walked away.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Poor brave geese," Grandfather said. "They are done for... 
            finished."
        </p>
        <p>
            The hours went by. At the bottom of the high hill, the watchers 
            became strangely quiet. Mother put their children to sleep in the
            wagons or lay down with them in the shade of the trees. The sun
            seemed to shine with a steady glare. After a time, some of the 
            watchers drove or walked away. Grandfather kept pulling out his
            watch to tell Aunt Mary the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The day, I thought, would never end. The long wait just about to 
            killed me. At last, that sun began to go down, my tired eyes
            following it all the way down. And then I waited and waited some
            more.
        </p>
        <p>
            At last, there they were, coming back. Their heads hung down. 
            There they were, coming down the hill, returning like a badly
            defeated army. The world had not ended... no heaven opened up. 
            They were back on earth, where they had nothing -- no homes, no 
            farms, no food, no money. Worst of all, their hope was gone; their 
            religion was gone. The women cried, the men looked pale and sickly.
            The children were hungry and tearful.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what was this? Grandfather smiled as he shouted. "Here come
            the Jewels." Mr. Jewel spoke to grandfather.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sir, I ask you to forgive me. Of course, you were right. If God 
            had wanted the world to end, why would he tell me, of all people.
            You understood this and tried to save me. And you did save me. For
            up there on top of the hill I discovered that God had not left me.
            It was I who had left God. I was full of pride. I was sure that I 
            could understand him. We should be punished for leaving God."
        </p>
        <p>
            Grandfather took Mr. Jewel's hand and asked him to come home with
            us. But he said no. "I am taking my family to California. Other 
            Believers are coming with us. There we will start a new life and 
            never leave God."
        </p>
        <p>
            We could do nothing to stop them and we knew that their going away
            was a terrible loss. I never saw Jed again. For me, the world had 
            really ended.
