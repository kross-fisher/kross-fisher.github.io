            When I was in the eighth grade I felt a great need for money of my own. I decided 
            that I was never going to get enough money to buy model planes by doing small jobs.
            I needed real mony --- the kind that at the age of 12 in the mid-1950s a kid could 
            only get as a newspaper boy.
        </p>
        <p>
            A friend was working as a delivery boy for the afternoon daily and told me when 
            there was a route for me. My dad seemed please with me. So I went for an interview 
            at the newspaper office. It was called "The Station." The man in charge, manager of 
            Oakland Tribune District 351, was Warren Barry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. BArry's office was at the back of the garage, separated by a desk made of rough 
            pine boards. He looked up at me when I went before him. Mr. Barry was in his early 
            30s, with a round face, a pair of glasses, and short hair. His blue eyes looked at me.
        </p>
        <p>
            His first question surprised me. "How's your work in school?" This seemed to have 
            nothing to do with riding a bike and tossing newspapers.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Okay." I responded.
        </p>
        <p>
            His frown said that might not be enough. "The rule is: school first. You have to 
            learn your lessons well first," he said. "Route Three has 55 papers. And on Sunday,
            they have to be delivered by 8 a. m.  Think you can carry that many?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I guess." I answered in a low voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You can't guess. You either can or you can't. It takes confidence, initiative (主动)
            and plenty of hard work to keep a route."
        </p>
            "You're afraid to ask for money? Because you've got to collect maybe a couple of 
            hundred dollars every month."
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought about how hard it was to ask my dad for money, but I answered "No."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Service is the key to your business. You miss a house, and you get a complaint.
            That's ten points off." Then he explained the system by which each boy was measured:
            five points for each new customer and ten points off for each complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had imagined that simply showing up would be enough to get this job. I had not 
            expected such things.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you think you can go door-to-door to beg people to take the paper?" came the 
            next question. It seemed somewhat shameful compared with the noble art of throwing 
            paper onto front doors. But with enough orders, Mr. Barry explained, the Tribune 
            awarded prizes --- model cars, trips to the state fair, even a week at Disneyland.
            No one from the town had ever made it to Disneyland. "Think you can make it?" Mr.
            Barry asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, if nobody else ever has---"
        </p>
        <p>
            He interrupted me: "Be the first, be the best!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I got lots of relatives in town." I said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's a start," he said. "But you've got to have a goal, Sledge, and I'm not 
            quite sure you even have a direction."
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't know either. Still, I got the job, and the first month, selling to my
            relatives, I won Mr. Barry's prize for the most orders: a four-inch-high gold and 
            silver plastic cup. I was delighted.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I ran out of aunts and uncles, Mr. Barry taught me how to get orders from door
            to door. It became a test, a personal challenge to turn an unwilling person into 
            an eager customer.
        </p>
        <p>
            In no time at all, The Station became a second home to me. Our routine never changed:
            We'd come in from school, talk and play around, check the point board for progress and 
            start folding papers on the wooden counters. Sometimes, for excitement, a water-gun 
            fight would break out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Barry always knew how to encourage us to work better. "All right," he would say.
            "Candy bar for the kid who can fold 20 papers first." He'd blow his whistle (which 
            he'd also blow whenever we got too noisy) and we were off. Or he would set up a box 
            outside to test who could throw papers most accurately. There was always a kid who 
            was good at one thing or another, and he seemed to know it. So different kids were 
            willing all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, to keep our interest high, he would come up with tricks that had nothing 
            to do with delivering newspapers. Our favorite was calling the Wizard.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Barry knows this Wizard who can read his mind." a big kid named Frank told us new
            ones in my second month on the route.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What does the Wizard do?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You pick a card and tell Barry. He holds it to his forehead and calls the wizard 
            and the Wizard tells you what the card is." Frank explained.
        </p>
        <p>
            I marched over and asked Mr. Barry to call the Wizard. No, he said, he didn't think 
            the Wizard was home. Besides you couldn't bother a great man like the Wizard all 
            the time. Soon all the boys were asking him, however, and he agreed to call.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Remember," Mr. Barry said, pulling a deck (一副) of cards out of the top drawers of 
            his desk, "If you have confidence and concentrate your mind you can do anything. Now 
            pick a card!" Frank pulled out the jack of clubs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Barry looked at the card.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then as 25 of us were climbing over one another's shoulders to see what would happen 
            next, he secretly dialed the Wizard's number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pressing the card to his forehead, he waited.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello, is the Wizard there?" Mr. Barry asked when the phone was finally answered.
            A long pause. "He is?" Pause. "Could you call him to the phone? There's a young 
            fellow here who doesn't believe he can read minds." Mr. Barry handed the phone to Frank.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello, Wizard," Frank said, trying to be cool. Then went expressionless.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What did he say?" we all yelled.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Jack of clubs."
        </p>
        <p>
            "He's lying. Frank's working together with Mr. Barry." someone yelled. Frank gave him a 
            light pat with his fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were always a dozen explanations, but Mr. Barry would not say how he did it. Only 
            that "a focused mind can achieve anything."
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon after, Mr. Barry got the idea for the final contest. So far, boys competed with one 
            another in the Station. What if we were divided into two teams, competing for a team 
            prize --- ice cream at the shop across the street? The boys went for it. My best friend 
            Tony Poveda and I, as captains (队长), chose up teams. In the end Poveda's team and my 
            team were almost too evenly matched.
        </p>
        <p>
            That first month orders went up for everybody. Soon, District 351 was one of the best 
            for the entire Tribune. We all had a lot of ice cream.
        </p>
        <p>
            When May rolled around, the Tribune's biggest contest started. Each kid who got 64 
            orders in three months would win a trip to Disneyland. At our next meeting, Mr. Barry 
            announced that our goal was to send every kid in The Station on the trip. The team 
            captain were to make sure as many as possible qualified.
        </p>
        <p>
            We started working in teams. We got orders in the town, and we went to other towns. At 
            the end of July, Mr. Barry announced the results: 18 of the 25 boys had won trips -- 
            the highest number ever. Cheers!
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's time to call the Wizard." I declared.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Wizard, Wizard, Wizard." everyone shouted.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Okay," Mr. Barry said, "pick a card." I picked the nine of hearts and got to hear 
            the Great Man on the phone. A strange, low, obviously Wizard-like voice said, "Nine 
            of hearts," and then hung up.
        </p>
        <p>
            That summer trip I won to Disneyland marked the end of boyhood. I was going into my 
            junior year in high school.
        </p>
        <p>
            One autumn day I was slow folding my papers. Just Mr. Barry and I were left in 
            The Station. I went up to his desk. He leaned back in his chair and put his hand 
            behind his head, waiting for me to say something. "I'm going to quit." I said 
            suddenly. "I got a lot of subjects this year. I want to go to college."
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a long pause, "I thought you might," he said. "And it might be the right time."
        </p>
        <p>
            He came around the desk and put an arm on my shoulder. "Sometimes everything seems 
            to change at once. Sometimes things seem unfair. But a man takes what life gives him 
            and makes the best of it," he told me. "I figure you got some growing-up business to 
            take care of now."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't know if I can take care of it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Just remember," he said, "You can do anything you put your mind to."
        </p>
        <p>
            One evening a couple of years later I ran into Mr. Barry. He was then home-delivery
            manager of 26 districts and had returned to our town on a visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You ever do the Wizard anymore?" I asked him. "How did you do it, anyway?"
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked me over carefully, trying, I suppose, to see if I was enough of a man to 
            deal with the important knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Easy," he said. "My friend Bob Provine at the paint store was working with me.
            I'd say, 'Hello, is the Wizard there?' and he'd start counting suits. If diamonds 
            was up I'd interrupt him with, 'He is?' after diamonds. Then he'd start counting up 
            from ace and I'd interrupt him after the right number with 'Could you call him to the 
            phone?' I'd hand the phone to a kid and Bob would speak in a strange voice."
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's it?" I asked, both skeptical and disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's it. Simple but not easy."
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent the rest of the night thinking how the Wizard was just like a lot of other 
            things in adult life --- untrue and disappointing. Three was no magic in it at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Barry had made it all seem simple, I now realize, but it had not been easy 
            motivating boys like me who had come to him without direction or purpose. And by 
            being active, challenging and amusing, he had helped us do better.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had totally misunderstood who and what the Wizard was. He was not an unknown spirit 
            with a strange voice at the other end of a phone line. He was standing right before me 
            with bright eyes behind his glasses the whole time. His magic had nothing to do with 
            mind reading and everything to do with mind shaping. And the magic was not an act.
            The magic was the man.
