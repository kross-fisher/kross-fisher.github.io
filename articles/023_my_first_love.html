        <h1>My First Love</h1>
        <p class="author">by James Stewart-Gordon</p>

            Watching old movies on late-night TV is sometimes a magic carpet
            that carries you to an earlier time. Recently, I found myself
            transported back to the summer when I discovered that being
            young and in love is tough enough, but being young, in love and
            too shy to say anything about it can take a long time to forget.
            Sometimes you never do.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 15, going on 16, I had never known any girls. Throughout the
            week I played football or baseball, and boxed every Friday night
            at the school (all boys) boxing club. Saturdays, if the school
            didn't have a game, I headed for the movie house where for a
            little money you could have a head full of dreams. The plots of
            the romantic films of those days were pretty much the same, but
            to me they were a mirror of life as it should be -- a lovely girl
            met a self-confident young man, who courted her with clever
            language instead of flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
            One rainy Saturday, after seeing a romantic movie I walked into
            the grocery store next door to the movie. Behind the candy
            counter was a girl I had never seen before. She was a blonde,
            about my age, and when she smiled she had a dimple. She was the
            most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I wanted to give her my
            brilliant smile and joke with her, but all I could do was point
            at a tray and say in a voice that trembled and broke: "Can I
            have a nickel's worth, please?"
        </p>
        <p>
            She got the chocolate, weighed it and put it into a white paper
            bag. Our hands nearly touched when I handed her my money. It was
            not until I got home that I realized I had been too astonished
            even to open the bag.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the next week I lived in a dream world filled with a blonde
            with a dimple, who smiled as I talked to her in bright dialogue
            learned from the movies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began my double life the following Saturday. Our team had a
            game scheduled, but I was up early planning for another look at
            my recently discovered love goddess. At the team bus, I made one
            of those decisions that have been known to change men's lives.
            "Coach," I said, "My mother has had a bad fall and I have to 
            get right home. I'll have to miss the game." Before he could
            question me, I sped off.
        </p>
        <p>
            The movie did not open for another hour. I walked past the store
            several times, saw the girl, started to go inside and then stopped
            -- I desperately wanted to say something to her, but I could think
            of nothing. Besides, I had begun feeling guilty about telling the
            coach a lie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I thought of a line from a movie: "Say, you're new around
            here." the words seemed perfect. There was a park nearby, and I 
            sat on a bench, practicing my opening line.
        </p>
        <p>
            when I finally got myself inside the store, trying as hard as I 
            could to walk easily, I went over to the candy counter, looking
            for the blonde. A dark-haired girl with long earrings was there 
            instead. Before I realized it, the line I had been practicing
            jumped to my lips, "Say," I said, "You're new around here."
        </p>
        <p>
            I lost my self-confidence completely then and fled to the movie
            house, where I sat, unable to follow the first five minutes of
            the movie.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was dark when I left the movie, my spirits had somewhat
            returned, and I decided to try the store again. The blonde with
            the dimple was standing behind the counter. I walked as steadily
            as I could toward her, tried to smile like the hero in the movie.
            I had never spent more than a nickel before on candy, but I felt
            this time I should spend more. Tossing my last coin on the
            counter, I said, "Make it a dime's worth."
        </p>
        <p>
            She smiled, filled the bag and handed it over. I took it with 
            what I felt was a casual gesture and started to say, like the
            one in the movie, "Be seeing you." But at that moment a very
            fat women with two very fat children pushed me out of the way
            with her elbow.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weeks that followed were weeks of wonder. My head was full
            of romantic ideas, and I began walking to the store almost daily
            after school, pretending to study the piles of goods in the
            windows while I watched for her blond head. I wondered how I 
            could meet her away from the store so I could talk to her. I had
            never been in love before. In the movies the first steps of boy
            meets girl always seemed so simple, but the way things happened
            in real life was more complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
            One Saturday the girl I had been waiting all week to see came
            from somewhere in the back of the store -- and before I could
            say anything she said, "Hello."
        </p>
        <p>
            Time stood still. When I could finally answer, I stuttered, "I'm
            going to the movie and I'd like some candy."
        </p>
        <p>
            She smiled, and I noticed that her eyes were very blue.
            "Chocolate?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, five cents' worth of chocolate." I heard myself saying. I
            couldn't take my eyes off her as she picked up the pieces and 
            dropped them into a bag. I knew there were three pieces for five
            cents, but the girl dropped in five pieces and took my nickel
            without saying anything. She was standing very close to me, her
            face turned up to me. I was about to thank her when the girl with
            the long earrings called, "Marie," and she turned away.
        </p>
        <p>
            So that was her name -- Marie! As in a dream I went to the movie,
            and several hours later I left the theater saying the name "Marie"
            over and over to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            That Friday at boxing my mind was still so much on Marie that I 
            forgot to move away when Tommy Walgren, the club's worst boxer,
            struck at my nose. Blood ran from my nose. Later, glad at his
            success, he took me aside and showed me a picture of a girl in a
            white dress. "Her name is Marjorie," he said. "I met her last week
            and she gave me her picture."
        </p>
        <p>
            I was surprised. "You just met her and she gave you her picture?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sure." Tommy said at once. "I'm goint to meet her tomorrow and
            give her mine."
        </p>
        <p>
            "My girl's name is Marie," I said. "She looks like movie actress
            Joan Bennett."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Wow," said Walgren. "Joan Bennett. You have her picture?"
        </p>
        <p>
            My face was red. "It's on the dresser in my bedroom."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Will you bring it to school next week?" Walgren asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sure." I said, in a casual way.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn't until I was in bed, still enjoying my moment of triumph,
            that I realized I had better get a picture of someone who looked
            like Joan Bennett. Then I remembered they had pictures of movie
            actress at store. If I could find an unknown who looked a little
            like Joan Bennett I could show it to Tommy. But I did not find a
            picture at the store. With a heavy heart, I turned to the candy
            counter. Marie was there, smiling.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello." she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a brief moment I thought wildly of saying, "Can I have your
            picture?" But I didn't. I just bought a nickel's worth of
            chocolate. Somehow I had to get up the courage to ask Marie to
            meet me where we could talk. But how?
        </p>
        <p>
            In one of the movies that afternoon a man said to a singing girl,
            "Meet me after the show." She did, and romance started. The line
            stuck in my mind, and I determined to try it on Marie. She would
            be pleased and agree. Then I could tell her how much she looked
            like Joan Bennett and ask for her picture.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the movie was over I headed to the candy counter. The
            dark-haired girl with the earring was there, but no sign of
            Marie. "Is Marie here?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "She went home," the dark-haired girl said. Then she looked at
            me. "You like her, don't you?"
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried to say something, but the words would not come. With a
            red face, I turned and ran out of the store.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Monday I went to school, very unhappy. Tommy was not there.
            He was ill and would be out for two weeks. This was nice. But 
            the dark-haired girl's question and my reaction weighed heavily
            on my mind, and I knew then and there that I could never face
            going back to see Marie.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Tommy returned and asked to see Marie's picture, I told him
            we had broken up. "So did Marjorie and I." he said. Neither of us
            ever mentioned our girls again.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did see Marie once more, but that was months later. One evening
            I had been downtown and was taking the subway home. The door
            opened and Marie got on. She smiled and came by me side.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello," She said, "have you been away?"
        </p>
        <p>
            I started to say something, but the noise of the train made it
            difficult and I had to bend close to Marie's ear. I could smell
            her perfume and it was wonderful. I could not remember a single
            line from a movie to tell her. We stood there silently until we
            were at my stop. As the doors opened there was a small piece of
            quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you still go to the store?" Marie asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," I replied. "Not anymore."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't work there anymore either." she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            My heart jumped. If I could find out where she worked, I could
            see her again. I started to ask, "Where do you work now?"
        </p>
        <p>
            She was beside me, her face turned up to mine. But then the door
            began to close and, without knowing what I was doing, I jumped
            off before I could get her answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was the last time I ever saw Marie.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other night, when that old movie on television was winding
            up, I thought of Marie, my goddess of the candy counter. I had
            been too young and nto experienced to let her know I wished that
            I could know her better, and as I got up and turned off the TV,
            I said to myself, "I bet I could have kissed her..."
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw my wife on her way upstairs, holding a number of magazines.
            "Hey," I called to her, "What are you doing after the show?" I 
            sounded just like the man in the movie and my face did not turn 
            red at all.
