            Charley was going blind, out of work, and angry, and did not 
            want to be interrupted by even the President -- much less by 
            the stranger at the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was early Tuesday afternoon, December 11, 1951. There was 
            a wet, wind-griven storm, blowing in from the Atlantic Ocean 
            25 miles away. More than six inches had piled up when darkness 
            closed in at 4:00 p. m.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charley Hall, 59, a large, strong farmer, hit angry fists on 
            the wheel of his old truck as he drove absent-mindedly through 
            the storm toward home three and a half miles north of Lisbon
            Falls, Maine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost blind, he drove the shaking vehicle over Bowdoinham 
            Road more from emmory than skill. Dismissed from the mill three
            months before, he felt terrible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The food supplies he needed for his wife and five children during 
            the winter were already running out. He'd gone into town to beg 
            for his old job. "I'm sorry, Charley, but we just can't put you 
            back to work, not with your poor eyesight." hsi former boss had 
            said an hour earlier. He turned the wheel hard and turned into
            the driveway. The back of his truck slid on the ice and crashed
            into the mailbox. His face twisted in anger as he stepped hard 
            on the gas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edie, the 7-year-old daughter, stared through the living room
            window and watched worriedly as her father approached the house.
            "Daddy's home!" she shouted. Her tone was a warning, not an 
            announcement. Dropping the curtain over the window, Edie fled to
            her unheated room in the attic. She turned on the lamp for warmth
            and crawled with it under thick covers. This was the one place she
            could escape the violence below.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 5:30 the family gathered silently, cautiously, in the kitchen
            for supper. The meal was always the same: corn or tomato with 
            milk, and homemade bread. There was no conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
            An hour later, Charley turned on an old radio to begin an evening 
            listening to his favorite programs. But this was no pleasant 
            portrait of a poor family spending an evening together. Their 
            family was poor, but what was worse, it was a family that lacked 
            love and normal affection.
        </p>
        <p>
            They came together, not because of warm human feelings but 
            because the kitchen was the only warm room in the old house. 
            Edie sat at the table, biting her lower lip as she cut paper
            clothes out of a book to put on her cardboard dolls. Melvin,
            aged 11, knew she wanted somebody to play with, so he sat down 
            and offer to help.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Only girls play with dolls." Ben, 13, laughed at him. Melvin's 
            face became angry and red. But before he could reply, his father
            hit his fist hard on the kitchen table. "Shut up so I can hear 
            my programs!" he roared.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edie blinked back a tear and looked at the Christmas tree standing 
            near the front window in the living room. She and Melvin had
            selected the tree, cut it down, and carried it home. Most of the 
            decorations vere hand-made. The only decorations that had been 
            bought were the lights and a few delicate balls their grandmother
            had given the family. And one more thing: on top of the tree stood
            a china angel with arms sticking out toward heven.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you believe angels really exist?" Edie asked Melvin in a
            whisper as she tried to break the silence in the room. Melvin 
            shrugged. "I don't know. But they talk about them in church, so 
            maybe they do."
        </p>
        <p>
            A loud knocking at the front door interrupted their conversation.
            A late-night caller. "Charley, somebody at the door," Elsie, his 
            37-year-old wife said. "Well, go see who it is and get rid of him,"
            he said impatiently, "Just leave me alone with the programs."
        </p>
        <p>
            A tall man with a beard stood at the door. He smiled pleasantly 
            when Elsie opened the door and stared at him in the darkness. 
            Standing behind her mother, Edie shyly watched the stranger. "I'm 
            sorry to disturb you so late, but I need to speak with Mr. Hall."
            the man said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well... I don't know..." Elsie said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's very important. Would you tell him I'd like to speak with
            him?"
        </p>
        <p>
            She hesitated. "I'll tell him, but I don't think he's... ah... 
            interested in talking with anybody."
        </p>
        <p>
            While he waited, the man knelt down on one knee by Edie and pointed
            at the Christmas tree. "I'll bet you made a lot of those lovely 
            decorations," he said. "Yes I did." she admitted, pleased that he'd 
            noticed. She liked the kindness in his eyes and the warmth in this 
            voice. She wondered what it would be like to have a daddy like him.
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked over the tree slowly and stopped when he saw the angel.
            She watched him studying the decorations. "Do you believe in
            angels?" she asked shyly. "Oh yes indeed!" he said firmly. "Don't 
            you?" "I don't know," she admitted honestly. "I wish I did, though,
            I'd like to meet one someday."
        </p>
        <p>
            The man gave a quiet laughter. "Maybe you have and just didn't 
            realize it," he suggested. She turned and looked into the 
            smilling eyes. "How would I know?" she asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            The question was interrupted by the sound of her father hitting 
            his fist on the table and shouting, "I don't care if he's the 
            president himself -- get rid of him!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't you worry, Edie," the man said as he stood up. "Angels 
            always let you know in someway. It's God's way of showing His love."
        </p>
        <p>
            Her mother returned, her lips tight. Before she could speak, the 
            stranger reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a white 
            envelope. "I'm sorry to have disturbed your family tonight," he 
            said, handing her the envelope. "I just wanted to leave this with
            you and tell Mr. Hall to report back to work at the mill tomorrow.
            He's got a new job there."
        </p>
        <p>
            He leaned toward the little girl, and kissed her lightly on the 
            cheek. "Merry Christmas. And don't forget what I said, Edie: 
            Angels always let you know. No Footprints."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What a strange man!" Elsie whispered as she nervously tore the
            envelope open. The contents slipped through her trembling fingers 
            and fell to the floor; three $100 bills. For a long moment, mother
            and daughter simply stared at the money and the door where the 
            stranger ahd stood moments before. Edie recovered first, picked
            the three bills up, and handed them to her mother. They both ran 
            toward the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Charley, you'll never believe what I've got!" Elsie cried.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't care what you've got. Will you please shut--"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't you dare tell me to shut up!" she interrupted. "You look 
            at this!"
        </p>
        <p>
            The usually nervous woman stood firmly in front of her husband and
            held the money out for his inspection. Shocked by the strength in 
            her voice, his jaw dropped as he silently stared at her in 
            astonishment. Then he saw the money.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What's that?" he asked in disbelief, pointing at the bills.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is what the man at the door came to give you -- along 
            with some good news. You go back to work at the mill tomorrow,"
            she said as tears filled her eyes. "I told you God would take 
            care of us."
        </p>
        <p>
            Charley got clumsily out of his chair. "Where'd the man go? Call 
            him back so I can talk to him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's funny; I didn't hear his car leaving." Edie said before 
            her mother could reply.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Get me the lantern!" Charley said. "He couldn't have walked 
            far in this snow."
        </p>
        <p>
            Edie had already run ahead and picked the lantern off the hook
            near the front door. Her father struck a match, lit it, and 
            stepped outside into the darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello!" he called. "Is anybody there?" Only a few flakes danced
            in the air. "I don't see anything." the nearly blind man compained.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edie pushed past her father. "Daddy, look at the ground," she 
            whispered. "What is it? What do you see?" he asked anxiously.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Dad, it stopped snowing before the man came. But there are no 
            footprints or tracks of any kind in the snow."
        </p>
        <p>
            Silently the family went back inside and closed the door. Elsie 
            and the children looked at one another as Charley stood with his
            back toward them. He kept clearing his throat and rubbing the back 
            of his hand over his eyes. "I just don't understand it!" he 
            whispered again and again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edie pulled on her mother's arm. "Mama, how did that man know my 
            name?" she asked. "I don't know, dear." Suddenly, a broad,
            delighted smile spread over Edie's face as she looked at the angel
            on top of the Christmas tree and remembered the stranger's last 
            words to her: Angels always let you know.

            Epilogue: This event in 1951 was the beginning of a change for the
            better in Charley Hall's life. He turned his life around died a 
            happy man 30 years later. I know because Edie, the 7-year-old child
            in the story, grew up and became my wife.
