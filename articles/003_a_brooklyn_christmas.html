        <h1>A Brooklyn Christmas</h1>
        <p class="credits">by F. Betty Smith</p>
        <p>
            Christmas was a wonderful time in Brooklyn.  The holiday was in the air long before it came.
            The first sure sign of it was the windows of the stores.  You had to be a child to know the 
            wonder of a store window filled with dolls, sleds and other toys.  And this wonder was free
            for a girl named Francy. How exciting it was for Francy to walk down the street and see 
            another store all ready for Christmas.  The clean shining window was filled with cotton to 
            look like snow.  On this cotton snow were boxes filled with dolls, dolls with golden hair,
            and other dolls which Francy liked even better.  Their hair was the color of rich coffee 
            lots of milk in it.  Oh, the deep blue eyes that look straight into a little girl's heart!
        </p>
        <p>
            Francy had never had such a doll. Her doll was a little one that cost only 5 cents.  Then 
            there were the sleds for sliding across the snow. One sled had a flower painted on it, a deep
            blue flower with bright green leaves. The sleds had wonderful names painted on them too, Rose
            Bird, Magnolia, Snow King, The Flier.  Francy thought, "If I could only have one of those, I 
            would never ask god for another thing as long as I live."  There were other beautiful toys in 
            the store windows and Francy felt weak from looking at so many wonderful things and thinking 
            about them so hard.

        <p>
            A week before Christmas, evergreen trees began arriving in Francy's part of Brooklyn. Christmas
            tree sellers tied ropes along the street.  They put the green trees against the ropes and sold 
            them to people who walked by.  All day, the sellers walked up and down their little street of 
            trees. The air all around smelled of the sharp green branches, the smell of Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few people stopped to choose a tree. They would ask the seller to keep it for them until
            the day before Christmas. Then they would take their tree home and cover it with colorful
            paper, glass balls and lights.  Some people stopped to ask the prices of trees. But most people 
            came just to look at the trees, to touch them or break a tiny branch to give off the wonderful 
            smell. The air was full of the fresh green smell of the trees.  The poor little street in 
            Francy's neighborhood was truly wonderful for a while.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a cruel custom in Francy's part of Brooklyn. It was about the Christmas tree that 
            has not been sold by 12 o'clock midnight on Christmas Eve. <i>The custom was this, after
            midnight, the sellers would give away the unsold trees to children, but getting one was not 
            easy.</i>  The seller would throw a tree at a child who wanted it. If you caught it without 
            falling down, you could keep it. But if you fell down, you gave up your chance for a free tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before midnight on Christmas Eve, children would gather around the unsold trees. The men would 
            throw each tree in turn, starting with the biggest tree. Many children would try to catch a tree.
            But only the strongest, roughest boys would try to catch the big trees. The littlest children 
            waited for the littlest trees. They screamed with happiness when they caught a Christmas tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this Christmas Eve, Francy was 10 years old. Her little brother Nily was nine. Mother agreed
            to let them have their first try to win a free tree. Francy had chosen her tree earlier in the 
            day. She had stood near it all afternoon, hoping that no one would buy it. To her great happiness,
            the tree was still there at midnight. It was the biggest tree, more that 3 meters tall. The tree's 
            price was so high, no one could buy it. The tree man took this big tree out first and got ready to
            throw it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before Francy could speak, a big rough boy, 18 years old, stepped forward. He demanded that the 
            man throw the tree at him. The man hated the way the big boy was so sure of himself. He looked 
            around and asked, "Anybody else want to take a chance on it?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Francy stepped forward, "Me, Mister." The tree man laughed. So did the children, and a few grown-ups 
            gathered to watch the fun. "I'll go on," the man said, "You are too little."
        </p>
        <p>
            Francy argued, "Me and my brother, we're not too little together."
        </p>
        <p>
            She pulled Nily forward. The man looked at the two of them, a thin girl of 10, who looked as if 
            she did not get enough to eat, a thin little boy with light hair and round blue eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Two catchers is not fair." shouted the big rough boy.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Shut your mouth," the tree man said. "These two kids have got nerve. Stand back, the rest of you.
            There kids are going to have a try at this tree." The other people stood in a line making a kind 
            of path. Francy and Nily stood at one end. The man with the big tree stood at the other end. The 
            man raised his arms to throw the great tree. He saw how small the children looked.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the breathless moment of time, the man struggled with himself. "Oh! Jesus," he thought, "Why 
            don't I just give them the tree, say Merry Christmas, and let them go. The tree means nothing to 
            me. It is too later to sell it this year and it will not last till next year."
        </p>
        <p>
            The children watched the tree man as he stood there in his moment of thought. But he said to 
            himself again. "If I did that, all the others will expect me to give them free trees, too. And next 
            year, nobody would buy a tree from me. They would all wait until I gave them away. I'm not a big 
            enough man to give away this tree for nothing. No, I am not big enough to do a thing like that. I
            have to think of myself and my own children."
        </p>
        <p>
            The tree man made his decision. "Oh, what the hell, these two kids got to live in this world. They
            got to understand it, they got to learn to give and to take punishment, and by god, it is nothing 
            but take, take, take, all the time in this world." He threw the tree with all his strength. And as 
            he threw it, his heart screamed to him, "It's a dirty, rotten, lousy world."
        </p>
        <p>
            With the smallest part of second, time and space have no meaning to Francy. The world stood still as 
            something dark and terrible came through the air toward her. The tree blocked every memory of her 
            life. There was nothing, nothing, but the sweet smelling darkness and something that grew larger and 
            larger as it flew at her. Francy almost fell as the tree struck them. <i>Nily fell to his knees, but 
            she pulled him up fiercely before he could go down completely.</i> There was a powerful swishing sound
            as the tree settled around them. Everything was dark, green, and sharp. Then Francy felt paint at the 
            side of her head where the tree had hit her.
        </p>
        <p>
            When some of the older boys pulled the tree away, they found Francy and her brother standing up, holding
            hands. Blood was coming from cuts on Nily's face.  But Francy and Nily were smiling.  They had won the 
            biggest tree. Some of the boys shouted "Hurray!" Some people clapped their hands, and the tree man 
            shouted "Now, get out of here with your tree. You damned lousy kids." Francy had her rough words like 
            those all the life. Such words had no special meaning to her or the other people on the street. The 
            unkind words came from people who had few ways to express their feelings. Such words could mean many 
            different things. It depended on the way they were spoken, and the sound of the speaker's voice.  So now,
            when Fracy heard the tree man called her and Nily "damned lousy kids", she smiled. She knew he was really 
            saying, "Goodby! God bless you."
