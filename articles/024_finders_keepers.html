        <h1>Finders Keepers?</h1>

            When my daughter reached the third and fourth grades, I occasionally allowed
            them to walk to and from school alone if the weather permitted. It was a short
            distance, so I knew they were safe and no trouble would happen to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            One warm spring day, a small friend followed them home after school. This 
            friend was different from any other friend they had brought home. She had 
            short thick legs and long soft ears, with a brown coat and tiny freckles across 
            her nose. She was the prettiest puppy I had ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            When my husband got home that evening, he said it was a hunting puppy, not more 
            than twelve weeks old, he guessed. She liked him right away and after dinner 
            climbed into his lap to watch TV. By now the girls were both begging me to keep her.
        </p>
        <p>
            She had no collar or identifying marks of any sort. I didn't know what to do. I 
            thought about running an ad in the lost-and-found but I really didn't want to. 
            It would break the kids' hearts if someone should show up. Besides, her owners 
            should have watched her more closely, I thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of the week she was part of our family. She was very intelligent and 
            good with the girls. This was a good idea, I thought. It was time the girls took 
            responsibility for another life so they would learn the skills they'd need if they 
            decided to become mothers when they grew up.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following week something told me to check the lost-and-found section in the 
            local paper. One paticular ad jumped out at me and my heart beat with fear at what 
            I read. Someone was begging for the return of a lost hunting puppy in the neighborhood 
            of our grade school. They sounded desperate. My hand shook. I couldn't brging myself 
            to pick up the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, I pretended I hadn't seen the ad. I quickly put the paper away in the 
            closet and continued with my dusting. I never said a word about it to the kids or 
            my husband.
        </p>
        <p>
            By now we had named the puppy. She looked like a girl named Molly, so, that was 
            what we called her. She followed the girls everywhere they went. When they went 
            outside, she was one step behind them. When they did housework, she was there to 
            lend a hand (or should I say, paw).
        </p>
        <p>
            Homework proved a challenge with her around. More than once the teacher was given 
            a homework page that the dog had chewed on. Each teacher was understanding and the
            girls were allowed to make it up. Life was certainly not the same at our house.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was only one problem with this otherwise perfect picture: my conscience
            was bothering me. I knew in my heart I had to call that number and see if our Molly 
            was the Puppy they were desperately seeking. It was the most difficult thing I've 
            ever done. Finally, with sweaty palms, I lifted the receiver and dialed. Secretly
            I was praying no one would answer, but someone did. The voice on the other end was
            that of a young woman. After I described the dog to her in detail, she wanted to 
            come right over. With minutes she was at my door. I had been sitting at the kitchen
            table, head in my hands, asking God for a miracle. Molly sat at my feet the whole 
            time, looking up at me with those big puppy-dog eyes --- eyes the color of milk 
            chocolate. She seemed to sense something was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            A thousand thoughts crossed my mind before the woman rang the bell. I could pretend 
            I wasn't home or tell her, "I'm sorry, you have the wrong address." But it was too 
            late; the bell rang and Molly was barking. I opened the door, forcing myself to face 
            my fear.
        </p>
        <p>
            One look at Molly and the woman's face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Here, Lucy,"
            she called. "Come to Mamma, girl." Molly (Lucy) immediately obeyed, wagging her tail 
            in delight at the sound of the woman's voice. Obviously she belonged to the woman.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tears came from the back of my eyeballs and threatened to run out at any moment. I 
            felt like my heart was being torn from my chest. I wanted to grab Molly and run.
            Instead I smiled faintly and asked her to please come in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The woman had already bent over and picked Molly up into her arms. She awkwardly 
            opened her purse and stretched out a twenty-dollar bill toward me.
        </p>
        <p>
            "For your trouble." she offered.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, I couldn't." I shook my head in protest. "She's been such a joy to have around,
            I should be paying you." With that she laughed and hugged Molly tighter to her chest 
            as if she were a lost child and not a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
            Molly licked her face and twisted with delight. I knew it was time for them to go 
            home. Opening the door to let them out, I noticed a little girl sitting in the front 
            seat of the truck. When the child saw the puppy, a smile as bright as a firecracker 
            on the Fourth of July exploded across her face.
        </p>
        <p>
            My glance turned to a small wheelchair strapped to the back of the truck. The woman 
            saw me look at the chair and offered an explanation without my asking. Molly (Lucy)
            was given to the child to help emotional curing after a car accident had left her 
            disabled for life. When the puppy disappeared from the yard, the little girl had gone 
            into a deep sorrow. Molly (Lucy) was their only hope their daughter would recover 
            emotionally and mentally.
        </p>
        <p>
            "She formed a special friendship with the puppy and Lucy gave her a reason to live."
            her mother explained.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly I felt very guilty and selfish. God has blessed me with so much, I thought. 
            My heart went out to this family that had been through such a terrible time. 
            As they pulled out of the driveway, the smile on my face was true. I knew I had done
            the right thing --- that puppy was exactly where she belonged.
