            He had given me the document about six months ago. Now he wanted 
            it and I wasn't sure I wanted to give it to him. I stood in the 
            hospital hall, unfolded the paper and started reading:
        </p>
        <p>
            To my family, doctor, and lawyer; to any individual who may become 
            responsible for my health and welfare: Realizing that death is a 
            certain thing and as much a part of life as being born, if the 
            time comes when I can no longer take part in decisions for my own 
            future, I wish this statement to stand as an expression of my
            wishes while still of clear mind...
        </p>
        <p>
            I couldn't go on. I folded the paper and walked to the window. I 
            looked out, but didn't see the trees and the flowers and the 
            parking lot below. All I could see was his face, and remember.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tuesdays and Fridays he went to senior-citizens meetings.
            Wednesdays he lunched and played cards at the Retirees Club. 
            Weekends he accompanied various widows around town. Mondays and 
            Thurdays he spent with me. My mother died after 63 years of 
            marriage. He was independent, smart and fun to be with.
        </p>
        <p>
            He carried my groceries to the car, and paid for our lunches at 
            McDonald's. I cut his hair, cleaned his house, ate the potatoes
            that he cooked "in their jackets" for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day, he brought me a piece of paper from the lawyer at the 
            Senior-Citizens Center. I didn't like it, but he made me take it 
            and then said, "Promise to bring it to me when I tell you."
        </p>
        <p>
            He was a special reason and I loved him very much. He was my dad.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although he was smart in almost everything else, Dad ignored
            obvious symptoms that he was not well. It became a struggle for 
            him to get his swollen feet into his shoes. Frequent pains struck 
            him in the stomach. His appetite shrank. "Nothing tastes good."
            he explained. After being away from home for several hours he 
            would be out of the car and into the bathroom before I could even
            get to the house. I worried and told him to be careful. He ignored 
            me. But one day the pain became greater than his will to ignore it.
            He growned as I called the doctor.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the test results came in, we met with the doctor, who
            explained that Dad had cancer: "It's probably spread to other 
            parts of the body."
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad took hold of my hand as he calmly asked, "How long?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's hard to say." The doctor was as pratical as Dad. "Sometimes 
            operation and medicine can slow the growth. But the most that I 
            can promise is to make you more comfortable. I would like you in 
            the hospital as soon as possible."
        </p>
        <p>
            A week later, more tests prove that the doctor was correct. Two 
            weeks and three operations later Dad came home from the hospital,
            more comfortable but with no promises. My sister and I took turn 
            staying nights and cooking for him until he said, "Enough. Go home.
            I'm fine." It was the first time he had ever lied to me. But I 
            understood. He wanted the remaining time to be as normal as
            possible. He wanted to be able to get up in the night, walk the 
            floor and drink a can of beer without someone there saying, "You 
            really shoudn't do that, you know."
        </p>
        <p>
            He took naps. He worked word games and played cards at the kitchen 
            table. Whatever his thoughts were, he bore them alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            We went for rides. He tired easily and waited in the car while I 
            shopped for groceries. At McDonald's he talked to babies and talked
            with their grandmothers. One day he let me carry our plates, and 
            I knew he was getting weaker. He had been home for 37 days.
        </p>
        <p>
            That evening I went to his house to check on him. He was sitting 
            at the kitchen table, not reading or playing cards, just sitting.
            I asked if he was all right. His voice shook as he answered, "No."
        </p>
        <p>
            I hadn't thought he would admit it. It scared me, and I knew why I
            had come. Dad was violently sick until 4 a. m., when he finally
            agreed to go to the hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time he was in for seven weeks. He had three more operations.
            Each day he would hold my hand and talk. One day he said, "Dear, 
            yesterday was your birthday and I didn't get you a present."
        </p>
        <p>
            No present? Every day of my life had been a gift from him. His lap
            had been my refuge from lightning and thunder. His arms had
            sheltered me from teen-age heartbreak. His wisdom and understanding
            had supported me as an adult.
        </p>
        <p>
            No present, Dad? You gave me life and helped me to live it. But I 
            couldn't tell him. My throat ached, and my eyes burned. He closed 
            his eyes before the tears fell out of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The doctor suggested one more operation to make him live a little
            longer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was sitting beside Dad's bed, listening. When we were along, Dad 
            spoke: "I've waited almost too long. Remember that paper I gave
            you?" He didn't ask what I thought about it. He simply said,
            "Bring it to me."
        </p>
        <p>
            In the hall outside his room I finished reading the document:
        </p>
        <p>
            "I fear hopeless pain more than death itself. I therefore ask 
            that proper medicine should be used to help relieve my suffering.
            And if there is no hope that I will recover, I request that I be 
            allowed to die with dignity and not be alive by artificial means."
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried to put myself in his place, knowing what he knew. It was 
            hard, but I finally admitted that it was his right to sign the 
            paper. His life. His decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            He sat on the bed, his thin legs with his swollen feet, cold and 
            blue, hanging over the edge. Several nurses stood quietly by as
            he signed his name and had the signature witnessed. The nurses 
            did not express agreement or disagreement, just acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that day, they became afraid to come to Dad's room. They 
            wandered in, touched him, relayed hospital news or asked him if 
            he wanted anything. He allowed just nurse to help him, his niece,
            who came twice a day. She would call him pet names. His doctor 
            continued to visit him daily, but more as a friend than a doctor.
            He had accepted Dad's decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was different with the cancer doctor. As a cancer specialist
            he could not give up. He begged Dad to change his mind, speaking
            of the rapid advancement in cancer treatment. Dad should have the 
            operation. Perhaps something, maybe tomorrow, would be discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad listened. He was weak but firm, and well aware of what he was
            doing. He seemed to relax, as if a burden had been lifted, and he
            entered a period of waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Late one afternoon, three weeks after he had signed the paper, I 
            kissed him as I left, and he smiled and said, "I'll see you later."
        </p>
        <p>
            When I returned that evening I saw that he was still and silent.
            He had turned his face to the window. The sun had just set, and 
            the sky was a beautiful color. Just for him, I thought, to 
            celebrate his freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            I closed my eyes as the nurse said, "He is gone."
        </p>
        <p>
            He had left me a precious heritage: a sense of humor, a love for 
            life, and the courage to live it. But most of all he filled in me
            a sense of honor that keeps me faithful to my responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of those responsibilities had been to allow him to make his 
            own decision. He wanted to be remembered alive, aware, smiling at 
            me, not as just a body connected to life-support systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            His decision was the last and best gift he gave to me. All my 
            memories are good. He lived the way he wanted and died the way 
            he chose.
