            Mrs. Henry Miller had lived alone for several years. Her husband was dead, but he had
            left her a comfortable amount of money. He also had left her a nice apartment in New 
            York City near the east river.  There were three other apartments in the large brown 
            building where Mrs. Miller lived with her bird, a yellow canary named Tommy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller was sixty-one years old. She had no friends and no special interests. One 
            evening in January, Mrs. Miller saw an advertisement for a movie. It looked so interesting 
            that Mrs. Miller decided to go to see it.  There was a long line of people waiting to buy 
            tickets for the movie. Mrs. Miller stood at the end of the line. Looking around her, Mrs.
            Miller noticed a little girl standing near the line. The child's hair was absolutely white,
            silver white in fact. The child was thin and delicate. She wore a blue silk dress under her
            red velvet coat. Mrs. Miller felt strangely excited, and when the girl looked at her, Mrs.
            Miller gave her a warm smile.
        </p>
        <p>
            The little girl walked over to her and said, "Would you do me a favor? Would you buy a
            ticket for me? They won't let me go into the movie alone."
        </p>
        <p>
            She handed Mrs. Miller the money and they stood together in line. Mrs. Miller felt there 
            was something strange about the little girl. Her eyes were gray and very large, but they
            did not seem like the eyes of a child.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What's your name, dear?" Mrs. Miller asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Miriam." the child replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller smile. "Why, isn't that funny? That's my name too. I'm Miriam Miller."
        </p>
        <p>
            The little girl was silent. By this time, they had reached the ticket office. Mrs. Miller
            bought two tickets. She gave one to Miriam and said, "It was nice to have met you, but I 
            must go now." Miriam just nodded her head.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next week, one evening after dinner, Mrs. Miller's doorbell rang. She opened the door.
            Her little girl in her red coat was standing there.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello." said Miriam. Mrs. Miller did not know that to say. Miriam stepped into the apartment.
            She took off her red velvet coat and dropped it on the chair. Her dress made a soft swishing
            sound as Miriam walked around the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What do you want?" Mrs. Miller asked. "And how did you know where I live?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Miriam laughed. "Let's talk about something else." she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            She walked over to the birdcage, which was covered by a piece of cloth. Mrs. Miller raised
            her voice, "Leave my bird alone!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "All right," Miriam said. "But I'm hungry."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Look," Mrs. Miller said, "if I prepare something for you to eat, will you be a good girl and go home?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I promise." the little girl said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller's hands were shaking as she made a sandwich and poured a glass of milk for Miriam.
            She kept asking herself who this little girl was and why she had come to her house. Mrs. Miller 
            carried the food into the living room. The room was empty. Mrs. Miller began to feel a little 
            frightened. She went into her bedroom. Her jewelry box was open and Miriam was looking at Mrs.
            Miller's jewelry. The child turned to the old woman, looking deeply into her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I want this pearl necklace." she told her.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Put that back!" Mrs. Miller ordered. "You can't have that. That necklace was a gift from my husband."
        </p>
        <p>
            "But I want it," Miriam insisted. "It's beautiful. Give it to me."
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller suddenly felt very weak. She felt as if she was goint to faint. Miriam put on the
            pearl necklace and went to the living room. She ate the sandwich and drank the milk quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That was very nice," she said when she had finished the food. "But I wish I had some cookies
            or chocolates."
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller sat on the sofa, her face was very white and her eyes were staring into her face.
            "You promised to leave if I made the sandwich." she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Miriam picked up her coat and put it on. Then she walked to Mrs. Miller. "Kiss me good night."
            She ordered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller trembled. "Please," the old woman whispered, "I... I don't want to."
        </p>
        <p>
            "All right," Miriam said, lifting her eyebrow. She walked slowly to the door, turned and looked 
            at Mrs. Miller, then she was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller spent the next day in bed. The day after that Mrs. Millerwoke up feeling much better.
            The sun was shining and when she opened her bedroom window, she discovered the weather felt almost
            like spring. The day was so beautiful, she decided to walk along the white avenues of New York's 
            east side.  When she came to a bakery shop, something strange happened. Mrs. Miller could not 
            stop her feet from carrying her inside the store. She spent ten dollars for a bag of chocolates 
            and some cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weather had changed again by the time Mrs. Miller came out of the bakery shop. Winter clouds
            threw gray shadows over the sun. A cold wind blew in the streets. Soon snow began to fall. Mrs.
            Miller hurried home. As soon as she entered her apartment, she put the chocolates on a plate with
            the cookies.  At exactly five o'clock, the doorbell rang.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Is that you?" Mrs. Miller called.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Of course," answered Miriam. "Open the door."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Go away." said Mrs. Miller. She sat down on a sofa. Mrs. Miller did not move for ten minutes.
            Then she walked quietly to the door and opened it a little bit. Miriam was sitting on a large 
            box outside the door. She was holding a beautiful French doll.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Really," Miriam said, "I thought you'd never open this door. Help me get this box into your
            apartment room. It's very heavy."
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller felt as if she was in a dream as she carried the heavy box into the living room.
            Miriam sat on the sofa, watching Mrs. Miller. She picked up a chocolate and put in into her mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I've come to live with you," she said. Mrs. Miller's face turned into a mass of ugly red lines.
            She began to cry and ran out of her apartment. She ran down the steps and began knocking loudly
            at the first door she came to. A short man with red hair opened the door. A young woman stood 
            behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Please," said Mrs. Miller. "I'm your neighbor. I live upstairs." She covered her face. "I'm
            afraid of a little girl. She won't leave my room. She's already stolen my pearl necklace and I 
            just know she wants to do something terrible to me."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Calm down," the young woman said. "Harry will to upstairs and take care of her." Mrs. Miller
            sat down. "You're very kind," she told the young woman, "and I'm sorry to cause you any trouble."
        </p>
        <p>
            After a few nimutes, they heard Harry coming downstairs. Harry came into his apartment, shaking 
            his head.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nobody is there," he said. Mrs. Miller stood up. "Did you see a large box or a doll?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, madam." Harry said, slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller went back to her apartment. The chocolates and cookies were still there but the 
            room was empty. "Where was Miriam? Where was she?" Mrs. Miller sat down. The room was dark and 
            getting darker. Mrs. Miller closed her eyes and began thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe there was no girl named Miriam. Maybe she had imaged everything, like in a dream. Mrs.
            Miller began to feel better. She was Mrs. Henry Miller. She lived in this apartment. She cooked
            her own meals. She felt safe and relaxed. Then she heard the sounds coming from her bedroom.
            Someone was opening and closing her drawers. Mrs. Miller sat with her eyes closed tightly. She 
            heard a soft swishing sound of a silk dress. The sound grew louder and louder until the walls
            of the apartment began to shake.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Miller opened her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello." said Miriam.
