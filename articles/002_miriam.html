            Mrs. Henry Miller had lived alone for several years. Her husband was dead, but he had
            left her a comfortable amount of money. He also had left her a nice apartment in New 
            York City near the east river.  There were three other apartments in the large brown 
            building where Mrs. Miller lived with her bird, a yellow canary named Tommy.

            Mrs. Miller was sixty-one years old. She had no friends and no special interests. One 
            evening in January, Mrs. Miller saw an advertisement for a movie. It looked so interesting 
            that Mrs. Miller decided to go to see it.  There was a long line of people waiting to buy 
            tickets for the movie. Mrs. Miller stood at the end of the line. Looking around her, Mrs.
            Miller noticed a little girl standing near the line. The child's hair was absolutely white,
            silver white in fact. The child was thin and delicate. She wore a blue silk dress under her
            red velvet coat. Mrs. Miller felt strangely excited, and when the girl looked at her, Mrs.
            Miller gave her a warm smile.
