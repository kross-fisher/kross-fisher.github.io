        <h1>My Father's Way</h1>
        <p class="author">by Gary Allen Sledge</p>
        <p>
            Pooch was my father's dog, a big, happy dog. She wore spots of
            black and brown on her coat of short, white hair, and was tall
            enough to meet me nose. My father loved Pooch for some unlikely
            promise he saw in her. I saw only trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pooch was clumsy as an ox and quite affectionate. I had to try
            every means to avoid her kisses. She was ten poinds heavier
            than I was, and sometimes she knocked me down. As an
            eight-year-old, I found such behavior unsuitable.
        </p>
        <p>
            That summer it was my job to take care of Pooch, since Dad was
            away during the week at "the Mountain", his sawmill on 200 acres
            of redwood and pine above the Russian River on the northern
            California coast. Mom and I stayed home because she didn't want
            me "growing up lonely and wild in the forest".
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad wore an old, brown hat, and with one side over his eye, he
            had the sharp, don't-talk-back-to-me look. I was very much
            afraid of him.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You mind your mother." he'd warn me before leaving for the
            Mountain every Monday morning.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, sir."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You water the lawn, hear, every day. Cut it on Wednesday."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, sir."
        </p>
        <p>
            "And Pooch needs some of the dog biscuits for her teeth and a
            walk morning and night." A walk with Pooch was like being
            dragged by a steamroller out of control.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You're the man of the house, understand?" I said I did, but
            I didn't quite see how spending valuable summer hours watering
            the lawn and feeding his dog meant I was the man of the house.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Dad left, Pooch always danced around his legs, with his
            tail beating like a thick rope against a flagpole in her eager,
            sad good-bye. Dad would kneel to receive her kisses while he
            stroked her ears. I thought it was disgusting to be kissed by
            a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad had groun up quick and tough, making his own way in the
            world, never asking a penny from anyone. He worked his way from
            Oklahoma to California, met and married my mother when he was 18
            and then was called up to war.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born a few months after he sailed out to Saipan, and I grew
            accustomed to be spoiled by a circle of females -- mother,
            grandmother and a half-dozen aunts. My father's return when I was 
            almost three interrupted that.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some ways, we failed to live up to one another's expectations.
            He wanted a rough son who could fish and hunt, while I was a
            bookworm who wanted a father to hold me in his lap and read to me.
            Taking care of Pooch was his attempt to make me tough and teach me
            responsibility. I hated the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad said that some day when he had time, he was going to train
            her. But the one time he took Pooch duck hunting, she came back
            with her tail drooping and a look of terrible shame on her
            sad-eyed face. It seemed that at the gunshot Pooch had sat down
            and begun to shake. Still, Dad did not give up on her. "That dog
            has excellent intelligence," he was fond of saying. "All I've got
            to do is teach her self-control."
        </p>
        <p>
            Pooch lived in a big doghouse that Dad had built behind a fence
            in our back yard. I hated going into those dirty grounds to feed
            that dog. Every morning I'd try to steal in and get her water 
            dish while she was sleeping. Only she was never sleeping. Out
            she'd jump, waving her tail, putting her foot in the dish and her
            paws on my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Always she'd jump for the gate before I could close it, for Pooch
            loved freedom more than anything. Then I had to run after her for
            at least ten minutes around the yard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes Pooch would jump over our five-foot-tall wooden fence,
            turn round and come jumping back. She'd keep that up -- with her
            tongue dropping and tail sticking up straight -- until she was
            out-of-breath. It was hard to have much respect for that dog.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Dad was home, he looked tired and anxious. I had some idea
            that money was the problem, and the mill was not making much of
            it. Late Sunday nights, after a full weekend of work around the
            house, Mom and Dad would sit at the dining-room table with worried
            looks on their faces, a pile of yellow bills and a black checkbook
            in front of them. Monday morning early, Dad would pack up his bag,
            kiss Mom and start back for the sawmill.
        </p>
        <p>
            Late in August Dad took Mom and me up to the Mountain for a
            couple of weeks' vacation. Because there was no way to take 
            Pooch that far in our car, Dad asked one of his hunting friends,
            a man with the name Claggert, to care for Pooch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Claggert's house was not painted, with an old car, and a bunch
            of kids running around barefoot. The youngest child was about
            a year and a half, and there was something wrong with his legs.
            He lay on the porch in a box while the other kids played around
            him. I tried not to look at him, yet I couldn't keep from
            glancing at him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Claggert tied Pooch to a clothesline so she could run, and Dad and
            I left. It was hard to listen to her sad crying as we drove away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Surprisingly, I didn't have a good time on the Mountain. Dad was to
            too busy to take me swimming or fishing, and later at night, lying
            under heavy quilts, I could hear my parents whisper about the bad
            times at the sawmill.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the day, I'd play on the logs. Imissed my friends, and I
            even began to wish that Pooch ws with me. At least then I could
            run up and down the dirt roads with someone, and we could run after
            squirrels and hunt deer together. At the end of two weeks, I was
            ready to go home.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Dad and I drove back to the Claggerts', the whole family came
            out on the porch. Mrs. Claggert was holding the baby with the 
            disabled legs. Mr. Claggert steppped forward with one of his sons
            about my age. He had Pooch on a rope.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hi, Bill," Claggert said. He seemed cheerful, but his eyes
            avoided ours. While he talked with my dad, I went over and
            patted Pooch on the head. Her big tail beat the ground, and she
            licked my hand. But in an unsusual way she sat politely still,
            as if they had taught her some manners. The kid gave me a funny
            look.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That dog's something," Claggert was saying. "The kids just love
            her. Smart! Bobbie. here taught Pooch to pull the little one
            around in a wagon."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," Dad said, "she'll be a good hunting dog soon as I get
            around to train her."
        </p>
        <p>
            Claggert cleared his throat. "You ever think of selling her, Bill?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, I won't sell it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I give you $50 for her."
        </p>
        <p>
            I held my breath. Fifty dollars was a unheard-of amount. Suddenly
            I was worried that Dad might take it, considering the bad times
            at the mill. Pooch was Part of our family. You don't sell family.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," my dad said, "she's just an ordinary hunting dog."
        </p>
        <p>
            "A hundred dollars."
        </p>
        <p>
            Where would this poor Claggert get a hundred dollars? Something 
            was wrong here. I saw a strange expression grow on Dad's face.
            "I don't want anything for her," he said firmly. "I just want 
            my dog."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Give her here, Bobbie." Claggert said and signed his son back
            to the porch. When my father tried to take the rope, Claggert
            held on.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'll fight you for her if I have to, Bill, but I have to keep
            this dog."
        </p>
        <p>
            My father regarded Claggert the way I'd seen him examine a snake
            that he'd kick or walk around. His hands held. "I told you she's
            not for sale."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I can't give her to you, Bill," Claggert begged. "My wife and
            kids won't let me." His face was twisted with pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You know my littlest has got bad legs. My wife puts him out on
            a blanket in the front yard there, and the kids are supposed to
            watch him. The other day, though, the kids were playing, and the
            baby crawled out in the road. My wife looked out the kitchen
            window and saw the baby lying on the road with a car roaring down
            on him! She screamed. Then Pooch jumped over the fence, ran up
            and grabbed the bady by his pants and pulled him out of the road.
            Sure enough, it was some drunk that stopped the car right over
            where the baby was."
        </p>
        <p>
            Claggert cleared his throat. "Pooch saved his life."
        </p>
        <p>
            Claggert looked at my father with eager eyes. "We love that dog.
            My wife makes her up a bed in the baby's room every night. We'll
            take care of her till the day she dies. I'll pay you any amount,
            Bill."
        </p>
        <p>
            My father waited in silence, then let go of the rope. "Well, I 
            told you I'm not selling her." He bent down and stroked Pooch 
            behind both ears and ran his hand gently down her smooth face.
            "So I'll give her to you."
        </p>
        <p>
            Claggert let out a cry of surprise, took Dad's hand and shook it
            hard. He looked back at his family on the porch and, with a big
            smile, nodded.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Come on." Dad said to me, and he started back down the dirt road
            to the car.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why'd you give her away?" I cried, tears coming to my eyes. "She
            is yours!" But I was thinking, She's mine! I feed and water her.
            I take her running.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad picked me us in his arms. "listen, son. There isn't a living
            thing a man can hold on to in this world unless he loves it and 
            works for it. Those folks love Pooch better than me. By rights
            she belongs to them."
        </p>
        <p>
            They don't love her better than me, my heart cried, now that it
            was too late.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Come on, be big. I know what you're fealing."
        </p>
        <p>
            He opened the car door and put me inside, up front with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, sir." I said, coughing back tears.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad got in, started the engine and then did something he now
            often did. He put his arm around my shoulder, drew me close 
            and kept me by his side all the way home.
        </p>
        <p>
            That fall, to support his family, my father finally had to give up
            his sawmill and take a job he did not like in a paper factory. But
            I had learned something important from him -- something more
            important than a lesson in loss. He showed me, in a world ruined
            by misfortune, what effort and sacrifice and kindness it takes to 
            be a man -- to hold on to the important things and keep safe the
            ones you love.
