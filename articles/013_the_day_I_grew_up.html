        <p>
            "There's no way you can deliver those cattle in time," Mother told Dad that October morning
            nearly 40 years ago. "He promised you ten days' notice, and he's given you three."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If I cna't deliver," Dad said, "He'll stop the contract."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Where are you going?" I asked -- a sleepy ten-year-old sliding into a chair at the breakfast
            table.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Got to round up a few cows." he said, leaning forward to test the steaming coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He's got to round up this place and your grandpa's place and the old Sanchez place," Mother said.
            "He's got to drive over 400 cows and calves to Vaughn, and he's got less than seventy-two hours to
            do it."
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a moment of silence.  Then she went on: "You know what'll happen, Ben? You'll risk your 
            neck in the dark, tire yourself out, get to town three hours late, and he'll say, 'Sorry you missed 
            the deadline.'"
        </p>
        <p>
            Two months earlier a buyer, Missouri, had contracted to pay Dad top prices for our calf crop. When 
            cattle prices fell only a week after the deal was concluded, Dad said how fortunate we had been to
            sell the calves when we did.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, early that Wednesday morning, the buyer called to say he had to have the calves in Vaughn by
            sundown Friday. If Dad failed to meet the deadline, he'd call off the deal.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Taste of the Real Stuff.</b> Looking at Dad across the table, I could see he was full of firm 
            determination, and at the same time strangely cheerful. "I guess it is impossible to deliver in 
            three days," Dad said. "But I want to be certain, and the only way I can do that is to try. If I
            don't, I'll go around here for the next five years thinking. Maybe I'd have made it if..."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What will you do with the cattle if you don't get there in time?" Mother asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Drive them back home," Dad said. "Sell them at a loss to someone else. Or feed them all winter on 
            the money we were going to spend putting in a bathroom."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I just wish you didn't have to do this alone." Mother said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'd use up a day trying to hire someone now, Lorene," Dad said. "You know where aren't half a dozen
            able-bodied men within fifteen miles of here at this time of year."
        </p>
        <p>
            "But if your horse falls, or if you get sick or hurt..." Mother paused to let Dad think of what she 
            said. "I think you should take Gerald along."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes!" I said, suddenly awake. "I can help."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't think so," Dad said in a low voice, considering the idea. "I don't think you can last."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Try him." Mother urged.
        </p>
        <p>
            "All right," Dad said, much to my surprise. "<i>It's time you got a taste of the real stuff.</i>
            Better start eating, cowboy. It's a long way to the next gas station."
        </p>
        <p>
            Mother promised to make arrangements at school so I could miss the rest of the week; then she handed
            me a heavy jacket. She put the remaining breakfast into a paper sack. "I want you to remember," she 
            said to Dad, as she put the sack into my hand, "that I've lived without a bathroom for ten years. I
            can last a few more."
        </p>
        <p>
            At the barn, Dad and I saddled horses and headed south for my grandfather's ranch. The fear that had
            made my belly uncomfortable since breakfast stopped once the horses settled into a steady pace among
            the New Mexico hills.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a little before noon when we let ourselves out through the south gate and entered the lands 
            of Manuel Vicente, 36,000 hectares of open grasslands. Vicente's land practically surrounded out 
            ranch, but that part of his land which separated my grandfather's ranch from our place was a "narrow" 
            corridor about eight miles across. It was this corridor we would have to cross later that night with 
            over 200 cows and calves. As we rode, I realized that cattle lost in this vast open space could be lost for months.
        </p>
        <p>
            My grandfather had no phone, but a neighbor who did had passed on word of our problem. He must have 
            saddled a horse and gone straight to work. When he met us at his north gate in mid-afternoon, he had 
            already gathered two-thirds of the cows and calves we had to move from his place.
        </p>
        <p>
            My grandfather was surprised to see me. "Long ride for a kid." he said.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Dad and Grandpa drew the route of the drive in the sand, I ate one of the biscuits Mother had
            given me, then another. There were six left. "Better hang on to those, Son," Dad warned. "Long time 
            before we'll see a kitchen again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Night Drive.</b>  Close to sundown the herd was gathered. Dad and I rode to Grandpa's barn and 
            changed horses. We took a long drink of water, ate four biscuits and pushed off.  The sun was just
            setting, pale behind the gathering cloud as we settled in for the night drive.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We won't try to hit our gate straight on," Dad said, "We'll drive the herd well south. When we hit 
            the fence, we'll follow it north to the gate. Don't move fast or yell, he warned. "If the break and 
            scatter out we're lost."
        </p>
        <p>
            "One more thing. In the dark, always look a little to one side of what you want to see. And save 
            those biscuits. This may be the longest night of your life, and the hungriest."
        </p>
        <p>
            A light rain began to fall. My coat turned the water, but my pants and hat were soon wet, and the 
            damp cold came in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad and I rode about 30 yards apart in the dark. If I looked just to one side of him, I could see 
            his shape moving beside me.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I looked directly at him, the details disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 10 p.m. my feet were numb inside my wet boots, and my muscles felt wooden after hours of tensing
            against the cold. I rode my horse to Dad. "I've got to eat." I said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "There's an all-night diner up ahead. Hold on and we'll get eggs and hot chocolate pretty soon."
        </p>
        <p>
            Visions of steaming food danced in my head so clearly that I forgot my trouble. I only half believed
            Dad, but I was willing to follow him along.
        </p>
        <p>
            When an hour pass without any sign of the diner, I was worried. "Do you think we could have passed that diner?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I doubt it. Just relax."
        </p>
        <p>
            It must have been after 1 a.m. when I decided Dad had fooled me about the diner. Trembling, hungry, 
            and angry with Dad for fooling me, I decided to give him a a piece of my ten-year-old mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Listen," he said, when I approached, "Maybe we ought to eat those biscuits." I forgot my anger and 
            turned around to get them out. Few things have ever tasted so good, or disappeared so quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I think we've hit our fence," Dad announced. "We'll be home in an hour. The worst in over. Just 
            imagine what your mother will have for us to eat."
        </p>
        <p>
            We hit the gate in 20 minutes. When Dad stepped off his horse to open it, after nine hours on 
            horseback, he walked like a drunk. We move the cattle into a small "holding" pasture near the ranch 
            house, where they could water before the big drive. Then we fed our horses, hung our saddles and went 
            off to the house.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>"I need your Help."</b> When I'd filled myself with eggs and beans and sausage and biscuits, Dad
            told me to get some sleep. Two hours later he was standing over me, shaking my foot. "Time to go, 
            cowboy," he said. "Come on."
        </p>
        <p>
            My body seemed paralyzed, and I didn't want to help any more. Dad woke me up, saying, "I realized 
            last night that I can't do this thing without you. I need your help."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What did I do?" I asked, fishing for more praise.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Helped me keep my mind off the cold and damp," he said. "That all-night diner helped me nearly as 
            much as it did you," he said, laughing. "Seriously, Son, I can see this is a two-man job."
        </p>
        <p>
            The day before I'd been a burden. Now I was a necessary part of an important job -- a major promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were back in the saddle by 8 a.m. It was noon before we finished gathering the herd from the old
            Sanchez place, a small ranch Dad had bought several years before. With just 29 hours left until the
            deadline, we still had all the cattle on our won ranch to round up. "We'll have to split up," Dad 
            said. "That's the only way we're going to get this done by dark."
        </p>
        <p>
            Until the moment, I had been extremely confident about meeting out deadline. Now I was not so sure. 
            I'd been so focused on myself the day before I did not take much notice of the larger problem of 
            meeting the deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you think we can still make it?" I asked Dad.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't know, Son," he said, his easy confidence gone now. Then, up ahead, we saw sight that gave
            us both the confidence we badly needed -- Grandpa's old blue pickup truck. "Papa's brought a horse 
            and come to help," Dad said. "We may make it after all."
        </p>
        <p>
            With Papa working the east pasture, our largest, Dad sent me to the west pasture. A day earlier I'd 
            have felt great fear going along, but now I simply rode to the far end and started driving the cows 
            back. I felt happy riding back to the house at dusk with 20 cows and calves.
        </p>
        <p>
            A little after nine we got back to our house. Mother gave a great sigh of relief and served up a warm,
            happy supper.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Short Notice.</b>  The big drive would begin in about six hours. When the sun next set, either Dad
            would have a fat check in his pocket, or we would have a lot of cattle a long way from home and hardly
            enough money to last the winter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't think I ever felt as much a part of my family as I did that night. My grandpa leaned toward
            me after dinner and said, "I was just about your age when I made my first big drive, you know. My
            father had to have my help. That's when you know for sure you're growing up, when they have to have
            to have your help."
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not remember clearly much of that next day. But I do remember the sharp Obtober air and how long
            it took the sun to rise and warm my back. I remember the rising and falling sea of reddish-brown bodies 
            of the cows flowing out before me through the endless afternoon.  After a time we were almost in a dream.
            When we first saw Vaughn's water tower in the distance it hardly seemed real.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sun was an hour from setting when the cattle were shut up. The buyer looked half-amused and 
            half-beaten when he shook Dad's hand. "I'm real sorry I had to give you such short notice." he said, 
            not even trying to sound sincere.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, that's all right," Dad said. He looked at me before he went on. "If you'd given us any less time, 
            we might have had to rush."
        </p>
