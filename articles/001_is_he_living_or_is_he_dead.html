            I was spending the month of March 1892 in a seaside town in the south of
            France.  This was a nice place, with beautiful sunshine, the pleasant air
            and the shining blue sea.  This place is quite, simple, restful, and
            natural.  As a rule, the rich do not come there.  Now and then a rich man
            comes, and I soon got acquainted with one of these.  I will call him Smith.
            One day, in one hotel, while we were having breakfast, he called suddenly.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Quick! Look at the main goint out at the door.  Look at him carefully."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you know who he is?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes.  He spent several days here before you came. He is an old, retired,
            and very rich silk producer, they say, and I guess he is alone in the world,
            for he always looks sad, and doesn't talk with anybody." After that he said
            nothing more about that man.
        </p>

            About ten that evening I ran across Smith, and he invited me up to his room.
            It was a comfortable place, with its comfortable chairs, its beautiful lamps,
            and its friendly open fire.  After chatting for some time, Smith said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'll tell you a curious history. It has been a secret for many years -- a 
            secret between three others and me; but I am going to tell it now.  Are you
            comfortable?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Perfectly. Go on."
        </p>
        <p>
            Here follows what he told me:
        </p>
        <p>
            A long time ago I was a young artist -- a very young artist, in fact -- and I
            wandered about the country parts of France, drawing here and there.  I was soon
            afterwards joined by a couple of darling young Frenchmen who were at the same
            kind of thing that I was doing. Although we were poor, we were happy.  Claude
            and Carl -- these are the names of those boys.
