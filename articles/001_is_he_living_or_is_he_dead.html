        <p>
            I was spending the month of March 1892 in a seaside town in the south of
            France.  This was a nice place, with beautiful sunshine, the pleasant air
            and the shining blue sea.  This place is quite, simple, restful, and
            natural.  As a rule, the rich do not come there.  Now and then a rich man
            comes, and I soon got acquainted with one of these.  I will call him Smith.
            One day, in one hotel, while we were having breakfast, he called suddenly.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Quick! Look at the main goint out at the door.  Look at him carefully."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you know who he is?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes.  He spent several days here before you came. He is an old, retired,
            and very rich silk producer, they say, and I guess he is alone in the world,
            for he always looks sad, and doesn't talk with anybody." After that he said
            nothing more about that man.
        </p>
        <p>
            About ten that evening I ran across Smith, and he invited me up to his room.
            It was a comfortable place, with its comfortable chairs, its beautiful lamps,
            and its friendly open fire.  After chatting for some time, Smith said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'll tell you a curious history. It has been a secret for many years -- a
            secret between three others and me; but I am going to tell it now.  Are you
            comfortable?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Perfectly. Go on."
        </p>
        <p>
            Here follows what he told me:
        </p>
        <p>
            A long time ago I was a young artist -- a very young artist, in fact -- and I
            wandered about the country parts of France, drawing here and there.  I was soon
            afterwards joined by a couple of darling young Frenchmen who were at the same
            kind of thing that I was doing. Although we were poor, we were happy.  Claude
            and Carl -- these are the names of those boys.
        </p>
        <p>
            At last we were penniless in village, and an artist as poor as ourselves took
            us in and saved us from starving -- Francois Millet
        </p>
        <p>
            "What! The great Francois Millet?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Great? He wasn't any greater than we were, then. He wasn't famous at all, even
            in his own village; and he was so poor that he hadn't anything to feed us on but
            turnips, and even the turnips failed us sometimes. We four became fast friends.
            We painted together.  We had lovely times together; but, oh! How hungry we were
            now and then!"
        </p>
        <p>
            For a little over two years this went on. At last, one day, Claude said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Boys, we've come to the end.  Do you understand that? -- absolutely to the end.
            We have no more money and we can not borrow any."
        </p>
        <p>
            We realized that our circumstance were desperate, now. There was a long silence.
            Finally, Millet said with a sigh:
        </p>
        <p>
            "We have to think of a way, lads."
        </p>
        <p>
            There was no reply. Carl got up, and walked nervously up and down a while,
            then said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's a shame! Look at these paintings. They are as good pictures as anybody
            in Europe paints."
        </p>
        <p>
            "They are so nice that, if a well-known name were attached to them they would
            sell at splendid prices. Isn't it so?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Certainly it is. Nobody doubts that."
        </p>
        <p>
            "But -- I'm not joking -- isn't is so?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why, of course it's so -- and we are not joking. What does that matter to us?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "In this way, comrades -- we'll attach a famous name to them!"
        </p>
        <p>
            The lively conversation stopped.  The faces were turned upon Carl. What sort of riddle
            might this be? Where was a famous name to be borrowed? And who was to borrow it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Carl sat down, and said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now, I have a perfectly serious thing to suggest. I think it is the only way to
            keep us out of the trouble, and I believe it to be a perfectly sure way. I believe
            my project will make us all rich."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Rich! You're mad."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, I'm not."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, you are. What do you call rich?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "A hundred thousnad francs each."
        </p>
        <p>
            "He is mad. I knew it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, he is. Carl, hunger has been too much for you, and --"
        </p>
        <p>
            "shut up!" said Millet, very seriously, "and let the boys say what he wants to say.
            Now, then -- tell us about your project, Carl. What is it?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, first, I will ask you to note this fact that many great artist have never been
            acknowledged until after he was starved and dead.  My project is this: we must cast
            lots -- one of us must die."
        </p>
        <p>
            The remark was so unexpected that we almost forgot to jump. Then he went on again with
            his project:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, one of us must die, to save the others -- and himself.  We will cast lots.
            The one chosen shall be famous, all of us shall be rich.  Here is the idea. During the
            next three months the one who is to die shall paint a great many pictures, not fewer
            than fifty a day.  All of them must be signed with his name -- they're the things
            that sell, you know, and are collected at astonishing prices for the world's museums,
            after the great man is gone. We'll have a lot of them already! And all that time the
            rest of us will be busy making a name for him -- preparations for the coming event,
            you know. And when everything is just right, we'll suddenly inform the world that he
            has died and have the great funeral.  You get the idea?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "N--o; at least, not qu--"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Not quite? Don't you see? The man doesn't really die; he changes his name and disappears;
            we bury a dummy, and cry over it, with all the world to help. And I--"
        </p>
        <p>
            But he wasn't allowed to finish. Everybody broke out into applause; and all jumped up and
            jumped about the room with joy.  For hours we talked over the great plan, without ever
            feeling hungery.  At last, when all the details had been well arranged, we cast lots and
            Millet was elected -- elected to die, as we called it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next morning, early, the three of us set out after breakfast -- on foot, of course. Each of us
            carried a dozen of Millet's small pictures.  Carl went to Paris, where he would start the work
            of building up Millet's name. Claude and I went to other places.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, it will surprise you to know what an easy and comfortable thing we had. I walked two days
            before I began business. Then I began to draw a country house near a big town -- because I saw
            the owner standing on an upper floor. He came down to look on -- I thought he would. I worked
            swiftly, intending to keep him interested. Finally the man spoke up, and said I was a master!
        </p>
        <p>
            I put down my brush, took one of Millet's paintings out, and pointed to the signature in the
            corner. I said, proudly:
        </p>
        <p>
            "I suppose you recognize that? Well, the taught me!"
        </p>
        <p>
            The man was silent. I said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "You don't mean to say that you don't know the signature of Francois Millet!"
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course he didn't know; but he said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "No! Why, it is Millet's, sure enough! Of course I recognized it now."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Next, he wanted to buy it; but I said although I wasn't rich I wasn't that poor. However,
            at last, I let him have it for eight hundred francs."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Eight hundred!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes. " Millet would have sold it for the price of the nice meal. Yes, I got eight hundred
            francs for that little thing. I wish I could get it back for eighty thousand. But that time's
            gone by. I made a very nice picture of that man's house and I sold it to him for a hundred.
            I sent the eight hundred francs straight to Millet from that town and started out again next day.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I didn't walk -- no. I rode. I have ridden ever since. I sold one picture every day, and never
            try to sell two. I always said to my customer:
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am a fool to sell a picture of Francois Millet's at all, for that man is not going to live
            three months, and when he dies his pictures can't be had for any money."
        </p>
        <p>
            Carl was soon in Paris and he did things with a clever hand. He made friends with newspapermen,
            and got Millet's condition reported to England and all over the continent, and America, and everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of six weeks from the start, we three met in Paris.  We stopped selling Millet's pictures.
            Everything was so ripe, that we saw that it would be a mistake not to strike right away, without waiting
            any longer.  So we wrote Millet to go to bed and try to die in ten days if he could get ready.
        </p>
        <p>
            We found that among us we had sold eighty-five small pictures, and had got sixty-nine thousand francs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day Claude and I went off to nurse Millet through his last days and send daily news to Carl
            in Paris to be published in the papers. The sad end came at last, and Carl was there in time to help
            in the funeral.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You remember that great funeral, and what a stir it made all over the world. We four carried the coffin,
            and would allow none to help. And we were right about that, because it hadn't anything in it but a dummy,
            and anyone else would have found out. Yes, we same old four carried the coffin--"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Which four?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "We four-- for Millet helped to carry his own coffin. In disguise, you know."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Astonishing!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "But true. Well, you remember how the pictures went up. Money? We didn't know what to do with it.
            There's a man in Paris today who owns seventy Millet pictures. He paid us two million francs for them. "
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is a wonderful history, perfectly wonderful! What became of Millet?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Can you keep a secret?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I can."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you remember that man I called your to look at in the dining room today? That was Francois Millet.
            For once they didn't starve a genius to death and then put into other pockets the rewards he should
            have had himself."
