            Jennet pulled the page from her typewriter and looked nervously 
            at her watch. It was almost time. From the inner office came 
            sounds of her boss preparing to leave, the sounds of doors 
            opening and closing. These sounds were well known to her after 
            eight years as a secretary. Then her boss himself stood at the 
            door, pushing a long arm into his coat. She saw how good he looked 
            in his gray suit. It seemed just right against his gray hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good night, Mr. Masen." she said with a weak smile.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good night, Jennet. I'll see you Monday morning as usual." He 
            was quick and friendly. Perhaps she only imagined the look of 
            concern in his eyes as he walked out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jennet covered her typewriter. She pulled a lipstick and a 
            mirror from her purse. Her hands were cold and trembling when 
            she began to redden her lips, and run a comb through her hair.
            There would be not time to stop at the woman's restroom this 
            evening to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            She felt a terror slowly rising up inside herself. How could she 
            ever go through with it? But she knew she must. It was too late 
            to stop. She reached into her drawer and pulled out a knitting
            basket and a ball of wool with the needles sticking out. At the
            bottom of the basket lay three microfilms, each in a metal case.
            She stared at them, feeling guilty. She felt a nervous shock as 
            the whistle blew. She stuck the wool back into the basket. She 
            seized her purse and took a last look around the office.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then she walked into the hall, filled with secretaries and clerks
            hurrying home. Doors opened and more workers walked out into the 
            hall. The click of high heels made the beating of Jennet's heart 
            seem louder, as she moved along with the crowd. It was like every 
            Friday. There was a noisy excitement in the air. Everyone was in
            a hurry to leave their desks. The weekend lay ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jennet held her purse in one hand, with the knitting basket hanging
            over her wrist. She pushed her way outside into the afternoon
            sunshine.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Easy now." she told herself. She stopped to let the crowd flow
            past her, as she looked ahead down the long ramp leading to the
            guard's gate. Her heart sank. Beside the regular guard Scotty,
            there was a guard she never saw before. He was helping Scotty
            inspect the people moving through the gate. He looked at their
            passes and badges. He looked into their purses and lunch pails,
            more carefully than Scotty had seemed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jennet drew back to the doorway of the building. As a rule, she 
            did nto leave so early, and had forgotten that an extra guard was 
            stationed at the gate at this hour. She noticed how tightly she
            was holding her purse.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Be calm," she said to herself. "Be natural. Everything depends on
            getting through that gate."
        </p>
        <p>
            Getting the microfilms had been easy enough. But getting them past
            the guard would be the test. She remembered how she and her husband
            Charles had gone over step by step what she was to do. They had
            prepared for months. It had sounded easy when Charles had given her
            the plan. He had worked it all out even before he told her what he 
            wanted her to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was well known that Jennet was still a young bride. It seemed
            natural, therefore, to use a knitting basket to smuggle the films 
            out of the plant. They chose the month when her old friend Scotty,
            the senior guard on the force, took his turn at the gate. She 
            often left the plant late, and stopped at the gate to chat with
            him. She talked about his boy, who was in the navy. And she spoke 
            about the little things she was knitting. A few times she tested 
            him, by being chatty, saying nothing about the knitting, and then
            passing her knitting through without inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The crowd at the gate got thin and the extra guard wave to Scotty 
            as he moved off in the opposite direction. Jennet closed her eyes a
            second and took a deep breath. Now, as naturally as possible, she
            moved down the ramp. She hoped the smile on her face did not appear
            as stiff as it felt. she swallowed twice before she greeted her 
            friend.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello, Scotty, how are you?" She felt a rush of guilt, as a smile
            broke across his face brown by the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good evenign Miss Jennet. You are early tonight."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, my husband is meeting me, Scotty." She held out her pass with
            her picture on it and pulled back her coat so she could see her
            badge pinned to her dress. Scotty nodded.
        </p>
        <p>
            "How is the knitting?"
        </p>
        <p>
            This was it. She removed a boby's woolen bootie, and held it out
            for his inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I've finished this one, but haven't done much on the other. Oh,
            there is my husband. Good night, Scotty."
        </p>
        <p>
            She wondered if her voice sounded as trembling to him as it did 
            to her only ears. She put the bootie back into the basket, and 
            walked past the guardhouse. She half ran along the sidewalk. 
            Scotty's "Good night" followed her. She forced herself to remain
            calm and slowed down. She walked toward the green car parked at
            the roadside, its motor running. She was shaking so much she could 
            not turn the handle of the door. Charles reached over to open it 
            for her, and she slid into the seat beside him. He looked at her.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Did you get them?" His voice was tense. He showed the pressure
            he must be feeling while sitting there waiting for her to come
            through the gate. "Yes." she nodded with a dead feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good girl! I knew you could do it."
        </p>
        <p>
            The car moved off into the traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Did you have any trouble getting the stuff?" Charles was pleasant
            again, and gave her cigarette. "Just try to relax," he said.
            "Everything is all right. I'll drop you off at the apartment as
            planned, and then deliver the microfilms."
        </p>
        <p>
            He turned on the radio. "Maybe some music will calm you."
        </p>
        <p>
            At last the car turned into a quiet street. Charles reached into
            the knitting basket, and took the three bright disks. He put them
            inside his coat pocket, then handed her the basket. He kissed her.
            "See you later."
        </p>
        <p>
            She entered her apartment. She crossed to the wide window and
            looked out. Her husband's green car was pulling away from the red
            light at the end of the street. She looked up and down the street,
            and then saw what she was looking for. A black car moved out from 
            the driveway beyond the apartment house, and followed her husband.
            Behind the black car was another one. Inside the car was her boss.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well," she said to the empty room, "that's that."
        </p>
        <p>
            But she continued standing looking out into the street, long after
            the three cars had disappeared from sight. She still felt numb,
            dead. She wondered when she would begin to feel something, the pain
            and guilt of a wife who had betrayed her husband. She thought back 
            over everything that led up to that betrayal, to the night, less
            than six weeks after their marriage. She lay with her head on his
            arm, and his hand gently stroke her hair. He confessed to her his 
            connections, and told her what he expected her to do. She
            remembered the horror she felt over this terrible request, the
            shock and disbelief. Her instinct had been crying out to rebel, 
            but some inner voice had warned her to be careful. This was
            something bigger than just herself and her marriage, a marriage
            now broken into little pieces. And it had been something bigger 
            than herself which made her tell her boss the facts. His calmness
            quieted her. She was able later to listen to a plan he developed 
            together with the FBI for her to go along with her husband's plans.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was almost dark outside when she turned from the window and 
            reached for a table lamp. She crossed the room she had shared with
            Charles. She took off her coat and opened a door to the closed
            closet. She reached for a clothes hanger.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly she stopped. One side of the closet was empty. All his 
            clothes were gone. She looked around the room; all his things 
            were gone, as if there never had been such a person as Charles 
            here. She was sharply hit by the full meaning of the situation. 
            Charles had never meant to return. She had just been his tool,
            married her for his purpose. She wondered how many other tools 
            there had been before her. She started to laugh. Then her 
            laughter turned into sobs. And she threw herself across the bed.
            As she gave in to her misery, there was a brief thought: "I'll 
            cry tonight. Tomorrow, I'll call my lawyer."
